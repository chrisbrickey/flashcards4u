Specify the pronunciation: 2 euros,deux‿euros ('duh-zoo-rhoh'; The X makes a Z liaison with euro.),vocabulary
Specify the pronunication: 500,cinq cents ('san-sohn'; The Q sound at the end of cinq is dropped because it is followed by a word.),numbers
Specify the pronunication: 600 coins,six cents pièces ('see-sohn-pee-ays'); The S at the end of 'cents' is silent because followed by word that does not start with a vowel.,numbers
Specify the pronunication: 700 cash, sept cents‿espèces ('sept-sohn-Zeh-spehs); Pronounce the S at the end of 'cents' as a Z because the following word starts with a vowel. A liaison is required.,numbers
Specify spelling and pronunciation of: 80 + 82 + 80 years.,80: quatre-vingts (silent S); 82: quatre-vingt-deux (remove S in spelling because followed by more numbers); 80 years: quatre-vingts‿an ('ca-tr-vuhn-Zan'; Keep the S in spelling because that is the word/number. Then the S makes a Z liaison with an.),numbers
1.000,mille; Never say: un mille. When you mean exact numbers: mille (1000) + deux mille (2000) + trois mille (3000) etc.; If you mean roughly (but not exactly) one thousand: un millier (thousands),numbers
roughly a thousand; Specify pronunciation.,un millier ('mee-lyay'); -ER (even when prefixed by an I) always sounds like 'ay'. The best example of this is at the end of every infinitive: marcher + parler,numbers

1.000.000.000,un milliaRd (one billion); Pronounce the R at the end. This is how to tell the difference between milliard and million (very nasal without an R sound).,numbers
2 billion euros,2 milliard D'euro; In this case the phrase is considered a quantity. So we add the generic DE (or D' if the noun starts with a vowel). Do not include an article. Do not agree in gender/number. Think of DE as a multiplication sign.; Whether you use a singular or plural object of the preposition depends on the type of thing (liquids are almost always singular and solids are often plural).,numbers
What time is it?,Quelle heure est-il?; pronounced ...'ay-teel' because we link almost all words AND when a vowel follows est then we must pronunce the T - otherwise it would be two vowel sounds together which does not work in french; Use quelle (feminine singular form) because huere is feminine singular.,numbers

9 o'clock in the morning / afternoon / evening., 9h DU matin / DE l'après-midi / DU soir; DE + LE/LA + time of day is the correct structure for expressing doing something at some time of day or the time at some time of day.; We are referring to a specific instant - not a duration. So use matin + jour + soir + etc.; In this case we are not dealing with a quantity so use more than the generic DE.,numbers

How does pronunciation of french vowels differ from english vowels?,French vowel pronunciation is more pure/defined. The sound is closer to the front of the mouth and the tongue and lips remain tensed throughout the pronunciation to form the strongly differentiated sounds.,pronunciation
What are the different ways to categorize french vowels?,Classification 1: Oral (air passed only through mouth) vs Nasal (air passed through mouth and nose). Oral vowels: A   E   I   O   U. Nasal vowels: AN   IN   ON   UN.;  Classification 2: Open (tongue low in the mouth) to Closed (tongue touching roof of mouth). This is a spectrum - not two distinct categories. Both oral and nasal vowels fall on the spectrum from very open to very closed.; 3) Classification 3: Effect on consonants C/G/S is either hard vs soft. Hard vowels: A O U. Soft vowels: E I Y.,pronunciation
How do you know whether a vowel should be pronounced as oral vs nasal?,Requirements for a nasal vowel: 1) The vowel is followed by N or M. 2) The vowel + N/M combo is not followed by a vowel. A vowel after the combo will force an oral pronunciation - instead of nasal. e.g. un is nasal. une is not nasal because the combo (UN) is followed by a vowel.; NB: The complete list of spellings that can create a nasal vowel: an + am + en + em + ain + aim + ein + eim + en + em + in + im + un + um + ym + yn + on + om + un + um.,pronunciation
In the first syllable of these two words (AM) which is oral and which is nasal? ampleur + ami,The first syllable (AM) of ampleur is nasal because there is no vowel directly after the vowel + N/M combo. The first syllable (AM) of ami is oral because there is a vowel directly following the vowel + N/M combo.,pronunciation
How do the phonetic symbols of oran and nasal vowels differ?,Nasal vowel symbols have a tilda over them. The oral (non-nasal) versions do not. e.g. [ɑ̃] is the nasal version of [a].,pronunciation
What are the spellings that could result in a nasal A [ɑ̃]?,an + am + en + em; A nasal vowel must be followed by M or N. And that combo must not be followed by a vowel.,pronunciation
What are the spellings that could result in a nasal I [ɛ̃]?,ain + aim + ein + eim + en + em + in + im + ym + yn; un + um are also typically pronounced with this sound because the nasal U [œ̃] has disappeared in much of France.; A nasal vowel must be followed by M or N. And that combo must not be followed by a vowel.,pronunciation
What are the spellings that could result in a nasal O [ɔ̃]?,on + om; A nasal vowel must be followed by M or N. And that combo must not be followed by a vowel.,pronunciation
What are the spellings that could result in a nasal U [œ̃]?,un + um; NB: In much of France [œ̃] has disappeared - it’s pronounced as a nasal I [ɛ̃] instead.; A nasal vowel must be followed by M or N. And that combo must not be followed by a vowel.,pronunciation
Why is there no such thing as a nasal E?,en + em can make a nasal sound (as long as they are not followed by a vowel). But they are either pronounced as a nasal A [ɑ̃] or a nasal I [ɛ̃].,pronunciation
List the nasal vowels in order from most open (tongue on bottom of mouth) to most closed (tongue touching roof of mouth)., Nasal A [ɑ̃] is very open. Nasal O [ɔ̃] is open. Nasal U [œ̃] is closed. Nasal I [ɛ̃] is closed.; NB: The most closed nasal vowel is still more open than many of the closed oral vowels.; Open/Closed sounds are also called Low/High sounds because the tongue is either low in the mouth (open sounds) or touching the roof (closed sounds).,pronunciation
List the oral vowels in order from most open (tongue on bottom of mouth) to most closed (tongue touching roof of mouth).,Very open... [ɑ] [a] [ɔ] [ə] [œ] [ɛ] [o] [ø] [e] [u] [y] [i] ... Very closed.; NB: The most closed nasal vowel is still more open than many of the closed oral vowels.; Open/Closed sounds are also called Low/High sounds because the tongue is either low in the mouth (open sounds) or touching the roof (closed sounds).,pronunciation
What are the two oral (non-nasal) A sounds?,1) [a]: It sounds like the vowel in 'hot'. Examples: acheter + à. 2) [ɑ]: It sounds like a mix between 'hot' and 'hat'. Examples: base + pas.,pronunciation
Pronounce these words which require an oral (non-nasal) A: ma + sa + caméra + quatre + là,Oral As are pronounced very strongly and sharply. ma ('mah') + sa ('sah') + caméra ('kah-may-ra') + quatre ('kahtr') + là ('lah'); It is important to prounounce an A strongly because this is one of the ways to indicate gender (e.g. MA maison).; There are two oral A sounds: [a] and [ɑ]. They are both extremely open - more open than any other oral vowels.,pronunciation
Pronounce these words which require a nasal A [ɑ̃]: grande + chambre + manger + santé,Nasal A sounds slightly more like an O. Close the mouth slightly and send the sound up through the nose. grAnd ('grahn') + chAmbre ('shahmbr') + mAnger ('mahn-zshay') + sAnté ('sahn-tay'); These As are nasal because they are followed by M or N. And the vowel + N/M combo is not followed directly by a vowel.,pronunciation
How are the following pronounced differently? à + â + a?,There is no difference. They are all pronounced the same depending on the letters surrounding them.,pronunciation
How are these pronounced differently? 'an' + 'am' + 'en' + 'em',Generally there is very little difference among these sounds. The vowels behave similarly depending on the surrounding letters. If these vowel sounds remain nasal then they are pronounced like a nasal A [ɑ̃] because there is no such thing as a nasal E pronunciation. And the consonants (N or M) are not pronounced strongly.,pronunciation
How do you pronounce accent grave vs la grève (the strike)?,grave ('grahv') + grève ('grehv'),pronunciation
How is a nasal A [ɑ̃] (e.g. an) pronounced differently than a nasal O [ɔ̃] (e.g. on)?,Nasal A [ɑ̃] is very open. The mouth is like in a big smile and the tongue rests at the bottom of the mouth. The sound is nasal but towards the back of the nose/mouth.; Nasal O [ɔ̃] is slightly less open. The mouth forms an o-shape - remember that closing the mouth slightly makes a sound more nasal. This sound is nasal but towards the front of the nose/mouth. The sound is short and a bit downward like a pout.,pronunciation
Pronounce these words with an open AN / EN sound: banc + sans + lent + Septembre + grand + jambre + champ + langue + dans + en + éléphant,EN and AN sound like 'ohn' but with the corners of the mouth pulled back. Think 'aunt' in British English.; banc ('bohnk') + sans ('sohn') + lent ('lohn') + Septembre ('sehp-tohmbr') + grand ('grohn') + jambre ('zshohmbr') + champ ('shohm') + langue ('lohng') + dans ('dohn') + en ('ohn') + éléphant (ay-lay-fohn'),pronunciation
Pronounce these words with a closed AN / ENT which sounds more like like 'ohn': an (year) + camp + tante + vent (wind),an ('ohn') + camp ('kohm') + tante ('tohnt') + vent ('vohn'),pronunciation
How do you pronounce the written 'ai'?,like 'ay'; e.g. j'ai is pronounced 'zshay'; Generally it is best practice to keep vowel sounds short - do not drag them out.,pronunciation
How do you pronounce the written 'au'?,like a closed 'o' (called a hard O in English); e.g. au revoir ('oh-rev-ror') + aujourd'hui ('ohn-jer-dwee'); NB: AU makes the same sound as EAU and as Ô.,pronunciation
Pronounce the following: sauce + pause + épaule,AU makes the same sound as EAU and as Ô... a hard/closed/downward O: sauce ('soes') + pause ('pose') + épaule ('ay-pole'); NB: AU is pronounced as one syllable but UA is pronounced as two syllables - two separate vowels.,pronunciation
What is this called: ç? What does it do?,C cédille; Ç is used to change the sound of a C from a hard K sound to a soft S sound. This is only necessary when the C is followed by A or O or U.; We do NOT need to make C cédille for ce or ci because those already sound like S. That is why the word c'est does not use C cédille.,pronunciation
How do you pronounce 'ce' and 'ci'?,The C here is soft like S so 'suh' and 'see'; to make it sound harder like K you write 'cue' + 'cui',pronunciation
How do you pronounce 'ca' and co' and 'cu'?,The C in this cases is pronounced like a hard K.; To make the C sound like an S... use C cédille ...'ça' + 'ço' + 'çu',pronunciation
How do you pronounce 'ça' and 'ço' and 'çu'?,The C cédille changes the C from a K-sound to an S-sound: 'sa' and 'so' and 'su'.,pronunciation
Pronounce these words with 'ch': réchauffement + chou + chauflouer,CH sounds like a soft 'sh' in English. réchauffement ('ray-showf-mohn') + chou ('show') + chauflouer ('show-floo-ay'); NB: The only words in french where CH makes the hard sound like 'chorizo' are words that are foreign to french. e.g. cheque from Czech.,pronunciation
Pronounce these words that end in -CIAL: artificial + provincial,artificial ('ahr-tee-fee-see-ehl') + provincial ('pro-vee-nsee-ehl'); When a french word ends in -CIAL pronounce it the same as the word for sky: ciel.,vocabulary
When is a 'd' pronounced like T?,When a liaison is required and the end of the first word is D. When you apply the liaison the ending D is pronounced as a T sound (e.g. un grand‿architecte is pronounced 'uhn-gran-Tar-shee-tehkt'),pronunciation
Generally how do you pronounce a regular E in French?,The phonetic symbol is [ə]. It's like the oo in 'good' (English). The lips are in an O-shape. Say 'uh'. The sound is high in the mouth.; The pronunciation may change depending on the letters surrounding the E.,pronunciation
Pronounce these words with a regular oral E sound [ə] ('uh' with very rounded lips): le + ce + que + petit + devez + sera + me + je + de + cheveaux + chemise + regard + depuis,The French E is like the oo in 'good' (English). The lips are in an O-shape. Say 'uh'. The sound is high in the mouth. le ('luh') + de ('duh') + me ('muh') + je ('zshuh') + ce ('suh') + que ('kuh') + petit ('puh-tee') + devez ('duh-vay') + sera ('suh-ra') + cheveaux ('zshuh-voh') + chemise ('zshuh-mees') + regard ('ruh-gar') + depuis ('duh-pwee'); NB: Avoid making any kind of R or gutteral sound unless there is actually an R in the word.,pronunciation
When do we drop (eat) an E in conversation?,1) Drop the E when the pattern is vowel + consonnant + E. (e.g. une ami de papa. Drop the E in DE because the pattern is I + D + E); 2) You can also drop the E when it is only preceded by a consonnant but that is the beginning of the sentence. e.g. Je préfère... Drop the E in JE.,pronunciation
When do we not drop (eat) an E in conversation?,1) Do not drop an É [e] which sounds like a short 'ay'. This sound is much different than a regular E [ə] and the pronunciation is much stronger (but it is short - not drawn out). 2) If the regular E is between two consonnants that are difficult to pronounce together then we cannot drop it. (e.g. De théâtre would be too difficult to pronounce if we drop the E in DE because it would push a D and T together - very difficult to pronounce.); 3) We cannot drop a regular E when there are multiple consonnants before the E (e.g. Prof de qoui would be too difficult to pronounce if we drop the E in DE because it would push P D and Q together.),pronunciation
How are these pronounced differently: de + cent?,1) DE is a regular oral (non-nasal) E sound [ə] because the E is not followed by M or N. Pronounce it like 'duh' with lips in O-shape.; 2) CENT has a nasal I sound [ɛ̃] because the E is followed by an N AND the pair are not followed by a vowel. So cent is pronounced like 'sOhn' (very nasal). The lips are still in an O-shape but the sound is sent through the nose.,pronunciation
How are these pronounced differently: le + tennis?,1) LE is a regular oral (non-nasal) E sound [ə] because E is not followed by M or N. Pronounce it like 'luh' with lips in O-shape.; 2) TENNIS is also a regular oral E sound [ə] but the pronunciation is slightly different: 'teh-nees' not 'tuh-nees' and the eh sound is elongated. Why? There is an -EN but it is not nasal because the double NN counts as a single consonant and then a vowel follows directly. However the double N in TENNIS changes the sound of the E. A non-nasal ENN or EMM sounds like an airy 'ehn' or 'ehm' respectively.,pronunciation
How do you pronounce: intermittent? Focus on the E sound in the middle of the word.,'uhn-tEHr-mee-tohn' The second syllable is not the regular oral E sound [ə] ('uh'). It is almost like the english word air but more aspirated.,pronunciation
How do you pronounce the first syllables of these verbs: rencontrer + rejeter + reapprocher + reessayer,rencontrer ('rUH-nkohn-tray') + rejeter ('rUH-zshuh-tay') + reapprocher ('rAY-ah-proh-shay') + reessayer ('rAY-uh-say-yay'); In the first two examples (rencontrer + rejeter) the first E is pronounced like a normal french E ('uh') [ə]. In the remaining examples (reapprocher + reessayer) the RE prefix is directly in front of a vowel. So we change the pronunciation of the first syllable to sounds like É [e]... even though there is no accent added.,pronunciation
What is the name of this character and how is it pronounced? é,E accent aigu sounds like a short 'ay' (do not draw it out). This is different from a regular E which sounds like 'uh'. The phonetic symbol for É is [e] = short 'ay'. There are other vowel combinations that can result in this sound.; Most of the time accent marks do not impact pronunciation significantly. É is the major exception.,pronunciation
When is É required?,É stops the pronunciation of a consonnant at the end of the syllable. Examples: étonnant ('ay-To-na' instead of 'ayt-o-na'; The consonant following è is forced to the following syllable) + préféré ('pray-Fay-ray' instead of 'pref-ay-ray') + première ('pruh-mehr'; If we used É instead of È then there would be one more syllable because é forces the separation),pronunciation
Pronounce these words with the closed [e] sound (sounds like 'ay'): pied + ses + et + chez + dizaines,pied ('pee-ay') + ses ('say') + et ('ay') + chez ('shay') + dizaines ('dee-zayn'); Closed [e] is the sound made by É (short 'ay') and many other spellings: ai + é + es + ei + er + ez,pronunciation
How are these pronounced differently?: -ez / -er / -é / -et / -ai,They are pronounced exactly the same like 'ay'. The phonetic symbol is [e]. These spellings are used often in verbs.,pronunciation
What is the name of this character and how is it pronounced? è,E accent grave (phonetic symbol [ɛ]) is pronounced like a light 'eh' at the top of the mouth. It has less 'uh' compared to a regular E. e.g. lève ('lehv'); It is pronounced exactly the same as Ê.,pronunciation
When is È required?,1) When an E precedes a terminal S: après + très + près.; 2) When the pattern is E + CONSONNANT (or 2) + SILENT E: mètre + grève + père + première. NB: Elever (infinitive) does not need an accent because the second e is pronounced as part of the last syllable. But j'élève (conjugated) requires è because the second is is now silent.; 3) To distinguish between some words. e.g. la vs là and a vs à,pronunciation
Pronounce these words with the open [ɛ] sound (written as È or Ê): êtes + près, êtes ('eht') + près ('preh'); Accent grave or circonflexe on an E change the sound of the E from the 'oo' in good to a lighter 'eh' sound.,pronunciation
What is the name of this character and how is it pronounced? ê,E accent circonflexe can be present on any vowel (not just E). But when it is placed on an E... it is pronounced exactly the same as È (a light 'eh' sound with open mouth). e.g. lève ('lev'). The phonetic symbol is [ɛ].; Accent circonflexe can impact pronunciation on other vowels. e.g. sur vs sûr.,pronunciation
What is the purpose of accent circonflexe (e.g. ê)?,When placed on an Ê... the accent does not change pronunciation. It simply indicates that the word used to have a consonant (often S) that has since been dropped. e.g. hôpital used to (before the time when English adopted french words) be spelled as we do still in English (hospital).

What is this character? How is it pronounced? Œ,Œ is a ligature of the vowels O and E. It signifies that the vowels should be pronounced as a single sound. That sound is like a mix of the classic french E (light 'uh' high in the mouth) and 'oo' (like book in English). The mouth is open and flattened.; The phonetic symbol for this ligature is [œ] but this can represent multiple spellings because ŒU sounds exactly like EU: un cœur and une heure sound the same and use the same phonetic symbol [œ].,pronunciation
How are these words pronounced differently? un cœur + un corps + un cours,un cœur ('keuhr'): ŒU sounds exactly like EU so this word rhymes with une heure. The sound [œ]has a lot of E in it and it is high in the mouth with flattened lips.; un corps ('kohr'): The O here sounds like a strong regular O ('oh').; un cours ('kewwhr'): This sounds more like a mix of 'ooo' and 'ewwww' sound.

Pronounce these words where EU is pronounced in an open way [œ]: ingénieur + beurre + peur + seul + fleur + cœur + œil + œuf + cooleur + heures + leur,[œ] (EU as an open sound) is pronounced like a mix of the classic french E (light 'uh' high in the mouth) and 'oo' (like book in English). The mouth is open and flattened.: ingénieur ('uhn-juh-neuhr') + beurre ('beuhr') + peur ('peuhr') + seul ('seuhl') + fleur ('fleuhr') + cœur ('ceuhr') + oeil ('euY') + œuf ('euf'; nasal open sound [œ] ending with F) + cooleur ('coo-leuhr') + heures ('heuhr') + leur ('leuhr'),pronunciation
Pronounce these words where EU is pronounced in a closed way [ø]: peu + ceux + feu + veux + monsieur + bleu + euro + cheveu + yeux + œufs,[ø] (EU as a closed sound) is pronounced like [œ] but more forced and with a really tightly closed and rounded O-shape with the mouth. So it is still a mix of 'uh' and 'oo'. The sound is still high in the mouth (not a deep U sound).: peu ('poo') + ceux ('coo') + feu ('foo') + veux ('voo') + monsieur ('mohn-soo') + bleu ('bloo') + euro ('oo-roh') + cheveu ('shuh-voo') + yeux ('yoo') + œufs ('oo'; closed sound [ø] without F),pronunciation
Pronounce these words where EU is pronounced in a closed way [ø]: adieu + lieu,adieu ('ah-dYoo') + lieu ('lYoo'); This is the same closed [ø] sound as peu + veux + euro. But the I in front of EU forces us to add a Y sound before the mixed 'uh'/'oo' sound.,pronunciation

What are the two oral (non-nasal) I sounds?,1) [i]: It sounds like 'ee'. Examples: six + ici. 2) [j]: It sounds like 'eey'. Examples: bien + any word that ends in -ion + any word with double I (ii).,pronunciation
Pronounce these words which require an oral (non-nasal) I [i] that sounds like 'ee': il + rire + imagine,Oral I [i] sounds like 'ee': il ('eel') + rire ('reer') + imagine ('ee-ma-zsheen'); The first syllable of imagine ('im') would have been nasal. But it is followed by a vowel ('a') which prevents a nasal sound. So both of the I's in imagine are oral so they sound like 'ee'.,pronunciation
Pronounce these words which require an oral (non-nasal) I [i] + L that sounds like 'eel': pile + il + fil (thread) + bile + avril + gilet + huile,pile ('peel') + il ('eel') + fil ('feel') + bile ('beel') + avril ('ah-vreel') + gilet ('zshee-lay') + huile ('ooeel'),pronunciation
Pronounce these words which require an oral (non-nasal) I [j] that sounds like 'eey': pille + famille + fille + grill + grille + maquillage + billet,The spelling ILL results in the second oral I sound [j] that sounds like 'eey'. pille ('peey') + famille ('fa-meey') + fille ('feey') + grill ('gril'; This does not have lle so the sound is like an L instead of a Y) + grille ('greey') + maquillage ('ma-key-ahj') + billet ('bee-yay'); NB: ville is an exception as it is pronounced 'veel'.; NB: The combination 'elle' does not result in a Y sound. e.g. elle + voyelle,pronunciation
Pronounce these words which require a nasal I [ɛ̃]: un + intégralité + inscrire + importé + simple,Un + Intégralité + Inscrire + Importé + sImple; Notice how each nasal I is followed by N or M. And the following letter is a consonnant (or absent). That allows the I to remain nasal.; Un is pronounced with a nasal I in much of France because the nasal U ([œ̃]) is disappearing.; Alternatively: imagine (vowel + single consonnant + vowel) has a non-nasal I ('ee') in the first syllable.,pronunciation
Pronounce these words which require a nasal I [ɛ̃]: INgénieur(e) + main + train + chien + fin + coin + nain + pain + rien + saint + teint + lien + vin + chien + point + prochain,INgénieur ('AHN-zshay-noor') is leading example for this group + main ('mahn') + train ('trahn') + chien ('shee-ahn') + fin ('fahn') + coin ('kwahn') + nain ('nahn') + pain ('pahn')+ rien ('ray-ahn')+ saint ('sahn') + teint ('tahn') + lien ('lay-ahn') + vin ('vahn') + chien ('shee-ahn') + point ('pwahn') + prochain ('proe-shahn'); NB: The last syllable of the masculine prochain is super nasal and the N is silent. This is very different from the feminine prochaine which is quick / non-nasal and the N is pronounced.,pronunciation
How do you pronounce all of these written syllables: in + im + ain + en + ein + ym + yn?,These all result in the nasal I [ɛ̃]. It's an open nasal sound that is a mix between 'ohn' and 'uhn' - like INgénieur ('uhn-geh-noor').; NB: If you switch the consonant from N to M (for all of these) the pronunciation is almost exactly the same because the M/N are not pronounced strongly.,pronunciation
How do you pronounce the first syllable of these words differently? Why? inscrire + tennis + imagine,1) inscrire ('uhn'): The first syllable is the nasal I [ɛ̃] (like INgénieure). 2) tennis ('teh-nees'): The first syllable is NOT nasal because the E is followed by a double consonnant. So it is regular E [ə]. 3) imagine ('ee-mah-zsheen'): The first syllable is not nasal because it (IM) is followed by a vowel. So it is an oral I [i] that sounds like 'ee'.,pronunciation
How do you pronounce important + inéligible + immueble?,important ('UHM-por-tahn' with the same open 'uhn' sound as ingénieur because IM is followed by consonant) + inéligible ('EE-nay-lee-zsheebl' because IN is followed by vowel) + immueble ('EE-mobl' because the double M acts as one consonant and then there is a vowel),pronunciation
Pronounce these words which use nasal semi-vowels: prévient [jɛ̃] + quotidien [jɛ̃] + besoin [wɛ̃],prévient ('prehv-yah') + quotidien ('koh-toh-dyah') + besoin ('beh-zwah'); [jɛ̃] makes nasal 'yah' sound. [wɛ̃] makes nasal 'wah' sound.; If a silent E was added after any of these it would kill the nasal sounds. e.g. Neither quotidienne nor envoie are nasal in their final syllables (because of the added E).,pronunciation
How do you pronounce double I (ii) in french?,It makes a Y sound.; This happens with verbs in the imparfait tense in the nous and vous forms. e.g. ÉTUDIER: nous étudiions + vous étudiiez,pronunciation

How was your day?,Comment ta journée s'est passé(e)?,conversation
It's ok / it's going alright,Ça va bien (merci).; The french use 'ça va' (just the two words) as both question (Is it going ok?) and response (It's going ok.).

I do not know. (when you're not familiar with the person/topic),Je ne connais pas.; Use CONNAÎTRE for familiarity - not for information.,verbs

I know that it is correct. + I know how to do it.,Je sais que c'est correct. + Je sais comment le faire.; Use SAVOIR (does not use direct object) to describe knowing how to do something or to introduce dependent phrase.

I know the man. + I know the concept.,Je connais l’homme. + Je connais le concept.; Use SAVOIR (does not use direct object) to describe knowing how to do something or to introduce dependent phrase.

Knowing that she is always late...,Sachant (participe présent) qu'elle est toujours en retard...,verbs
I understand.; Specify pronunciation.,Je comprends ('shhhhhkohm-pruh' slowly). It is NOT 'shuh-kohm-pruh'.; JE is always pronounced 'shhh' when spoken and it runs directly into the next consonant. It is never its own syllable. But it is also not rushed. The goal is to make the sound correctly - NOT to say it more quickly. The slow shhhh (instead of a quick 'zshuh') will make the speech more fluid and easier to understand by others.,conversation
I heard/understood incorrectly.,J'ai mal entendu.; Use the adverb MAL and the verb ENTENDRE (to hear).,conversation
a misunderstanding,un malentendu; J'ai mal entendu. = I heard/understood incorrectly.; NB: malcompréhension does not exist! You can use: une incompréhension = an inability or refusal to understand / to do something justice,conversation

I did not understand everything. + I understood most of the sentences.,Je ne comprenais pas tout. + Je comprenais la plupart DES phrases.; la plupart is like a fraction or percentage so it does not follow the rules of quantities. Use the partitive prepositions (du / de la / des) to agree with the gender/number of the object of the preposition.; NB: In this case the entire subject ('la plupart des phrases') is a plural subject - not singular.,conversation
I understood a lot.,J'ai très BIEN compri.; Do not use beaucoup in this case.,conversation
I did not understand. + I did not understand well.,Je n'ai pas compris. + Je n'ai pas BIEN compris.; Adverbs are placed between the auxiliary and past participle in passé composé (with PAS).; NB: The subject pronoun JE can be shortened to the sound 'sh' (in front of any verb) and the vowel is dropped completely so you lose an entire syllable. e.g. Je n'ai pas compris. ('shay-pah-cohm-prhee'),conversation
I do not understand what they say.,Je ne comprends pas ce qu'ils disent.; QUE contracts with any word starting with a vowel.,conversation
I do not understand them. + I cannot understand them.,Je ne LES comprends pas. + Je ne peux pas LES comprendre.; In the latter there are two verbs POUVOIR + COMPRENDRE. LES (them) relates to comprendre - not pouvoir. So the pronoun LES is placed before comprendre - not before pouvoir.,pronouns
It's still difficult for me (despite...).,Ça reste difficile pour moi.; Translating STILL depends on the context (e.g. the continuation of a time period vs emphasis). In this case 'ça reste' is a good choice even though we are using still for emphasis.; peu à peu... AND au fur et à mesure... can also be used to mean a continuation.,conversation
I still only understand some sentences.,Je continue de NE PAS comprendre quelques phrases.; Translating STILL depends on the context (e.g. the continuation of a time period vs emphasis). In this case use the verb CONTINUER (to continue). Use DE to link to the additional verb.; To negate an infinitive place both NE and PAS before the infinitive.; peu à peu... AND au fur et à mesure... can also be used to mean a continuation.,conversation
I still can't hear the difference.,Je n'entends toujours pas la différence.; Translating STILL depends on the context (e.g. the continuation of a time period vs emphasis). In this case TOUJOURS is a good choice instead of adding a second verb.; With only one verb NE and PAS are in their standard places to negate the phrase.; peu à peu... AND au fur et à mesure... can also be used to mean a continuation.,conversation
My ears are not used to french.,Mes oreilles ne s'habituent pas au français.,conversation
My oral comprehension is not good.,Mon comprehension oral n'est pas très bonne.; Adding pas to an adjective totally negates it and makes it negative instead of neutral. e.g. pas parfait does not mean 'not perfect' it actually means 'the opposite of perfect' e.g. pas formidable does not mean 'not great' it means 'the opposite of great'.,conversation
Did you understand the exercise?,Familiar: T'as pige l'exo?; Formal: Tu as comprends l'exercise?; NB: T'as is a contraction of the subject TU and the verb AS. This contraction is really common in conversation but you should not do it in formal communication.,conversation

I am getting better (at some skill). + I will get better (at some skill).,Je m'améliore. + Je vais m'améliorer.; SE AMÉLIOR = to improve (oneself).

I will improve (speaking french). + I will improve (dancing).,Je vais améliorer mon français. + Je vais améliorer ma danse.; AMÉLIOR = to improve. We do not use the verb reflexively in this case because the object (dancing/speaking) is explicit.,verbs
to get worse,s'empirer; Use the reflexive version of verbs when we mean say 'get' in English because the subject is also the object.; Alternative: DEVENIR pire (literally: to become worse). This is a very familiar/casual way to express this. You do not need to use a reflexive pronoun with DEVENIR because the verb assumes that the subject is also the object.,verbs
The crowd is worsening. (formal and informal versions),Soutenu (formal): La foule s'empire. (SE EMPIRER) + Familiére (informal):La foule devient pire.,verbs
I get worse. (formal and informal versions),Soutenu (formal): Je m'empire. (SE EMPIRER) + Familiére (informal): Je deviens pire.,verbs
It got worse.,Ça s'est empiré (s'empirer).,verbs
I will get it (eventually understand something).,Je compredrai.; I will understand - using futur simple. This is a good way to express this sentiment.; Remember that the subject pronoun JE can be shorted to sound like 'sh' (in front of any verb) so you lose at least one syllable: Je comprends. ('shcohm-prah').,conversation
It takes time to understand.,Ça prend du temps pour comprendre.; This is an idiomatic expression in french that is very similar to the expression in english.,conversation
how quickly the people speak,à quel point les gens parlent vite; à quel point is an idiomatic phrase that emphasizes the frequency or volume of something - how much something (some verb) happens,conversation
I like X. + I really like X. + I really really like X.,J'aime X. + J'aime bien X. + J'adore X.; All of these phrasings are appropriate at any level of speaking/writing (informal and formal). But generally AIMER (alone) is used for people: Je t'aime. AIMER BIEN and ADORER are used for objects including compound verbs.,conversation
I like to dance. + I like red wine.,J'aime bien danser. + J'aime bien le vin rouge.; You do not need any preposition after aimer or adorer to join with another verb. e.g. J'adore danser.,conversation
I don't like rose wine. + I don't like to sing.,Je n'aime pas de vin rosé. + Je n'aime pas chanter.; Negation of the verb AIMER is completely appropriate when you are expressing that you do not like some inanimate object. But if you were trying to express that you do like an inanimate object do not use AIMER alone. Instead use AIMER BIEN or ADORER.,conversation
I don't like peanut butter.,Je n'aime pas le beurre de cacahouète.,conversation
I don't like to have too many things in the apartment.,Je N'aime PAS AVOIR trop de choses dans l'appartement.; When you negate a compound verb (one conjugated verb + one infinitive) then you do not add a preposition (like DE) in between the two verbs - PAS is sufficient.,conversation
I like cocktails a lot.,J'aime BEAUCOUP les cocktails.; This is how you express that you like something a lot.; Beaucoup is modifying the verb in this case (instead of indicating a quantity of the thing that is liked). You are not saying 'I like a lot of cocktails'. So there is no DE between beaucoup and the noun (les cocktails).,conversation
I like a lot of cocktails.,J'aime BEAUCOUP DE cocktails.; Beaucoup is a quantity in this case (instead of modifying the verb aimer). You are not saying 'I like cocktails a lot.' So you must use BEAUCOUP DE (with the generic preposition).,conversation
My husband likes to cook a lot.,Mon mari aime BEAUCOUP cuisiner.; In this case beaucoup is an adverb (modifying the verb: cuisiner). So we do not use preposition DE.,conversation
I like both.,J’aime bien les deux.; Always use an article before a noun (deux). Use AIMER BIEN or ADORER for objects. Use AIMER (alone) for people.,conversation
I like it.,J'aime bien. This is the best option. Omit the pronoun (for the thing that you like) completely in this case.; You could also say: J'aime ça. But that is not idiomatic french.,conversation
She likes her. + She likes it (la fromage).; Explain the exception in choosing the object pronoun.,Elle l'aime. + Elle aime bien. OR Elle aime bien ça. (NOT Elle l'aime.) This is a special case where we sometimes omit the object pronoun completely in french. AIMER is intended to be used for people (not objects). So in the first sentence we can replace her with the pronoun LA. In the second sentence the object is an inanimate object so we use ça (or omit it completely) instead of using the COD pronom (la/le).,pronouns
He hates her. + He hates it (la fromage).; Explain the exception in choosing the object pronoun.,Il la deteste. + Il deteste ça. (NOT: Il la deteste.); This is a special case where we sometimes omit the object pronoun completely in french. DETESTER is intended to be used for people (not objects). So in the first sentence we can replace her with the pronoun LA. In the second sentence the object is an inanimate object so we use ça (or omit it completely) instead of using the COD pronom (la/le).,pronouns
I enjoy writing.,Je prends du plaisir à écrire.; The best way to express this sentiment in french is: PRENDRE + DU PLAISIR + À + the desired thing or action; This is an exception to how generally connect two verbs because it uses À instead of DE.,conversation
I enjoy it.,J'y prends du plaisir.; Use pronom Y to represent the object because PRENDRE DU PLAISIR triggers À before the object when you are not using a pronoun.,pronouns
I really like it when the people around me are having a good time.,J'aime bien / J'adore quand les personnes autour DE moi passent un bon moment.; Use autour DE because all directional prepositions use DE (e.g. à côté DE).; Use MOI (instead of me) because there is a preposition before this pronoun.,conversation
I really like being surrounded by others (indicating you are a social person).,J'aime bien / J'adore quand des personnes m'entourent. This uses the verb ENTOURER (to surround). Use ME pronoun (instead of MOI) because there is no preposition between ENTOURER and its object.; Less idiomatic alternative: J'adore être entouré(e) PAR des personnes. = I like being surrounded BY people. Preposition PAR (= by way of) explains causation in terms of the manner or the place.,conversation
I like to learn about a new culture.,J'aime bien connaître une autre culture.,conversation
to see the world from another culture's perspective,voir les aspects d'un autre culture / d'une autre personne,conversation
I enjoyed their culture.,J'ai bien aimé leur culture.; Use aimer bien to express enjoyment. If you use profiter de (e.g. Je profite de leur culture...) then you must explain exactly what benefit you receive from experiencing the culture.,conversation
I like to be immersed in a new culture.,J'aime bien m'immerger dans une nouvelle culture.; Use the verb S'IMMERGER (to immerse oneself).; 'dans une culture' would be a bit vague. It is better to specify what culture you are talking about in this case.; un séjour en immersion = a long stay abroad with the purpose of immersing in a different culture; un séjour linguistique = a stay abroad to improve a foreign language,conversation
I really like being surrounded by the parisian culture.,J'aime bien être entouré(e) PAR DE la culture parisienne.; NB: Using 'de la culture' (instead of just 'de culture') leaves the expression a bit open in a good way. There is a sense that you might enjoy other cultures too. For example if you said: J'aime bien être entouré(e) PAR la culture parisienne. (without de) ...This connotes that your enjoyment is limited (or more targeted) to this specific culture - not extended to others.,conversation
the empire that surrounded the world,l'empire qui entourait (imparfait) le monde,vocabulary
I want to integrate into a community.,Je voudrais m'intégrer dans une collectivité.; S'INTÉGRER = to integrate or assimilate,conversation
I know of him. + I know of it (le gorgonzola).; Explain the exception in choosing the object pronoun.,Je LE connais. + Je connais. (NOT Je le connais.); This is a special case where we sometimes omit an object pronoun completely in french. CONNAÎTRE is intended to be used for people (not objects). So in the first sentence we can replace him with the pronoun LE. In the second sentence the object is an inanimate object so we use ça (or omit it completely) instead of using the COD pronom (la/le).,pronouns
Do you like X? (formal and informal),Aimez-vous X ? / Aimes-tu X ?,conversation
a formal way to ask: Do you like it? (used by venders when presenting an item).,Ça vous plaît ?,conversation
The bedroom pleases me. (a common way to express pleasure in french),La chambre me plaît. PLAIRE is the verb. Add the reflexive pronoun (me) when the person being pleased is implied.; PLAIRE is irregular: je plais + tu plais + il plaît + nous plaisons + vous plaisez + ils plaisent,verbs

I would like to take that kind of trip again.,Je voudrais refaire ce genre de voyage.,conversation
idiomatic way to say: I will check it out. (when someone recommends a song/artist); Specify pronunciation.,Je le ('zszszszluh') checkerai ('cheh-khray').; The JE is followed by an L so it's a long 'zszszs' instead of 'shhhhhh'. CH in checkerai is pronounced like an english CH because this is an anglicisme. The last two syllables collapse - drop the E.,conversation
to sing + to rap,chanter + rapper; RAPPER can be spelled with one or two Ps.,verbs

Go ahead. (when you are opening the door for someone or letting them go ahead of you),Vas y. (informal; pronounced 'vah-zee') + Allez y madame/monsieur. (formal; pronounced 'ah-lay-zee'),vocabulary
How was it? (informal),Ça a été? (sa-EH-tay) ...really common and shortened; There is an implied 'bien' in the phrase. The full formal version might be '(Est-ce que) ça a (bien) été ?',conversation
It's nice.,C'est sympa.; This comes from the word sypathique which means friendly/pleasant/nice - not sympathetic.,conversation
It's great. Give at least 3 options.,C'est génial. C'est super. C'est formidable. Incroyable!/Remarquable! C'est magnifique. C'est fabuleux. C'est extraordinaire. C'est top (like the English word).; NB: pas top = not very good,conversation
It's perfect. + It's cool.,C'est parfait. + C'est chouette ('shweht').; Chouette (same m/f) means brilliant or cool but in a kind way.; You could also say: C'est cool. ...but this is very anglais.; NB: la chouette = owl.,conversation
It tastes great.,C'est délicieux. ('day-lee-sow'),conversation
It was good.,C'etait bien.; literally: It went well. This is idiomatic french.; Bien is an adverb (well) that describes a verb. So we do not use bon/bonne/bons/bonnes (the adjective for good) in this case.,conversation
It was a good day.,C'etait une bonne journée.; We use the feminine journée because we are referring to the things that happened during the day (duration). Do NOT say: C'etait un bon jour. That would imply that there is something special about the day regardless of what happened - like a lucky date.,conversation
It was a good weekend.,C'était un bon week-end (masculine).; Use bon/bonne/bons/bonnes because good is an adjective that modifies the noun. We do not use bien (well) which would need to modify a verb.,conversation

What is an alternative way to express 'not interesting' (that avoids ennuyant and ennuyeux)?,C'est monotone.,vocabulary
the annoyance,l'énervement (masculine); Watch out because énervé(e) means angry - not annoyed.,vocabulary
annoying,Depends on context. The best way to express 'it is annoying': C'est chiant(e). This is slightly informal. It connotes that the thing pisses you off / is shitty. It is appropriate for most situations (formal and informal). But if you are in a very formal situation then choose a different expression.,vocabulary
She is annoying (like rubbing you the wrong way).,Elle est désagréable.; Use this when the person is speading a bad energy.; Alternative: lourd(e) means heavy but it can also mean annoying when someone is insisting on something a lot.,vocabulary

to bother / to annoy,Three verbs: 1) DÉRANGER (to bother/mess up; the opposite of RANGER = to put things back in order) 2) ÉNERVER = to annoy (the verb). Watch out because énervé(e) (the adjective) means angry - not annoyed. 3) GÊNER (to bother/hinder/trouble). Gêner connotes a physical sensation but it can be used figuratively. 4) S'AGACER 5) PERTURBER,verbs
That noise annoys me.,Ce bruit m'agace.,verbs
The cat annoys Ellen. + The cat annoys her.,Le chat agace Ellen. + Le chat l'agace.,verbs
I am annoyed.,Je m'énerve.; The translation of this adjective is not direct. Options: 1) ne supporter pas: Je ne supporte pas le chien. = The dog really annoys me. 2) S'ÉNERVER; NB: Do not use the adjective énervé(e). That means angry - not annoyed.,verbs

The sound annoys me.,Le son me gêne.; Use GÊNER (to hinder) reflexively to express this.,verbs
the boredom,l'ennui,vocabulary
It's boring.,C'est ennuyant(e) ('uh-nee-yohn(t)') OR ennuyeux ('uh-nee-yow') / ennuyeuse ('uh-nee-yooz'). Both words mean boring (not annoying).; ENNUYANT(E) is a newer and more commonly-used word than ENNUYEUX/EUSE. And there are some cases where ennuyeux/euse sounds bizarre. So defer to ennuyant(e).; Alternative definitions: ENNUYANT(E) describes something that is temporarily boring/annoying. ENNUYEUX/EUSE describes something that is actively or persistently boring/annoying.,vocabulary
Two idiomatic ways to express: It was boring.,1) neutral: Ça m'a laissé froid. (literally: It left me cold.) 2) very harsh/dismissive: Je me suis fait chier. (literally: I shat myself ...because it was so boring.),vocabulary
It bores me. + It doesn't bore me.,Ça m'ennuie. + Ça ne m'ennuie pas.; ENNUYER is commonly used to describe something that bothers/annoys - even though the translation is closer to 'to bore'.,verbs
It bored him.,C'était ennuyeux pour lui.,verbs
to be bored,This is expressed as a verb (instead of an adjective): S'ENNUYER ('suhn-noowee-yay').; Do not use the adjective ennuyé(e). This means to have a problem and you really don't know what to do about it. e.g. Je suis ennuyée. DOES NOT MEAN I am annoyed.,verbs
I am bored.,Je m'ennuie.; In French we use a verb (S'ENNUYER) to express this instead of an adjective.,verbs
She is bored.,Elle s'ennuie.; Use a verb (S'ENNUYER) instead of an adjective to express this in French.; S'ENNUYER ('suhn-noowee-yay'). The middle syllable has two vowel sounds but they are squished together and pronounced rapidly almost as a single syllable.,verbs

a worry/concern,une inquiétude (milder) OR une préoccupation (stronger) OR un souci (informal); e.g. pas de soucis = no worries / no problem,vocabulary
worried / concerned,inquiet(e); The T is only pronounced in the feminine version. This is how you tell the difference between the adjective form and the verb (s'inquiéter) because the T is always pronounced when conjugating the verb.,vocabulary
It worries me. + It doesn't worry me.,Ça m'inquiète. + Ça ne m'inquiète pas.,verbs
Il worries the others.,Il inquiète les autres.; S'INQUIÉTER = to be bothered by (the subject) is the most common way to use this verb. But we can use INQUIÉTER alone = to bother (the object). So when you want to describe an independent subject and object then you do not use the verb reflexively.,verbs
The boss doesn't care. / It doesn't bother the manager.,Ça ne dérange pas le patron.; DÉRANGER = to bother,verbs
It bothers me. + It doesn't bother me./I don't mind.,Ça me dérange. + Ça ne me dérange pas.; Use DÉRANGER reflexively to express this.; NB: Ça m'embète. = It's annoying / not cool / bothering me. (more colloquial),verbs
He doesn't care about the details.,Il ne se soucie pas des détails.; This uses SE SOUCIER (to worry oneself or bother oneself with something). It's the same base as pas de soucis (no worries / no problem).,vocabulary

There's nothing specific that bothers me.,Il n'y a pas une chose précise qui me dérange. / ...qui m'inquète.,verbs

idiomatic way to express: I will keep it in mind.,Je le ('zszszszluh') garde à l'esprit.; When JE is followed by an L it does not sound like 'shhhh'. Instead it sounds closer to an English J 'zszszszs'. But it is still a long slow sound without forming a separate syllable.,vocabulary
idiomatic way to express: It's all in my head.,C'est dans ma tête.,vocabulary
It's on my mind.,Ça me monte à la tête.; Alternative: C'est dans mon ésprit.; Do NOT use cerveaux unless you mean the physical brain.,vocabulary

idiomatic way to express: to keep one's cool (to not get angry),garder son sang froid,vocabulary
to look after someone + to take care of someone,se occuper de quelqu'un + prendre soin de quelqu'un; S'OCCUPER can also be used for 'to deal with'. It's more about management. PRENDRE SOIN is more about care.,verbs
I deal with the clients.,Je me occupe DES clients.; S'OCCUPER de quelque chose = to be busy with something or to look after something. It is also used for business settings so this is the correct choice for managing clients.,verbs

to hold a position (in a company),occuper un poste,verbs
to be busy with something + to deal with something,être occupée AVEC quelque chose + s’occuper DE quelque chose; S'OCCUPER always triggers DE: S'OCCUPER + DE + Noun or Verb. It can mean to be busy with something + to look after something + to deal with something.,verbs
We were busy with paperwork (e.g. for immigration),On était occupé AVEC les documents (or use slang: la paperasse).; Use occupé(e) as an adjective when you mean someone is busy with something. Use the verb S'OCCUPER if instead you mean that someone is dealing with something.,verbs

idiomatic way to say: I'll bring the wine! / I'll take care of the wine! (when deciding who will bring what to a party),Je m'occupe d'ammener du vin.; S'OCCUPER + DE + Noun or Verb.; S'occuper can mean to be busy with something + to look after something + to deal with something.,conversation
idiomatic way to say: I'll take care of it! (to take it off of someone else's plate),Je m'en occupe.; S'OCCUPER always triggers DE so the pronoun to use is EN. S'occuper can mean to be busy with something + to look after something + to deal with something.,conversation

the flavor,la saveur (the specific type of flavor; e.g. strawberry ice cream) OR le goût ('tastiness' in general),vocabulary
We ate well.,Nous avons (très) bien mangé.; Bien is the adverb that modifies the verb manger. Generally the adverb is placed before the verb it modifies. Because bien is an adverb it does not adapt to agree (in number or gender) to the verb it describes - unlike adjectives.,conversation
I am hungry.,J'ai faim ('fah'; Same pronunciaion as fin. The M is silent.).; la faim = the hunger; It's really important to not pronounce the M in faim. Otherwise it sounds like femme.,conversation

because,Many options: 1) parce que ('par-se-kuh')   2) car   3) en effet    4) puisque ('pwee-squh' actually 2 syllables) Use when the reason is fairly obvious/evident. It is preferred for exams.; Use parce que (instead of à cause de or grâce à) for most scenarios and especially when you follow with a phrase. e.g. Because I went to the store... = Parce que je suis allé(e) au magasin...; NB: Comme can be used to mean 'because'. e.g. Comme il fait beau... = Because the weather is nice...,vocabulary
So... / Therefore... (conversational bridge hinting at causation),Many options: 1) ainsi... This must be placed at the beginning of the phrase. It is slightly formal. It is preferred (in comparison to donc / alors) for exams - oral and written. 2) alors... 3) donc... ('donk') Can be placed in multiple places. Watch out because DONK means fuck or damn. 4) du coup ('dewww-koo') This is very familiar and mean 'as a result'. This is a great word to understand the difference between french U sound (the first syllable - low in the mouth - lips in tight O shape) and OU sound (the second syllable - higher in the mouth - like english 'oo'). 5) C'est pour ça que... 6) si bien que... 7) de sorte que... 8) à tel point que... 9) C'est pourqoui... 10) par/en conséquence... is a little formal.,vocabulary
Because of X...,Generally use one of two expressions depending on the context. 1) À cause de + noun: used when the consequence is negative. 2) Grâce à + noun: (literally 'thanks to...') used when the consequence is positive. 3) A more casual approach: par rapport à (e.g. I said it because of your face. = Je disais ça par rapport à ton visage.); NB: Use à cause DES + plural noun. Use grâce AUX + plural noun.; Alternative: Par consequent... This is a better way to start a sentence (as opposed to Parce que...).,vocabulary
with negative connotation: Because of technology... + Because of cars...,À cause DE LA technologie... + À cause DES voitures...; Use DE for singular nouns and DES for plural nouns.,vocabulary

They were imprisoned for steeling a necklace.,Ils ont été emprisonnés pour avoir volé (infinitif passé) un collier.; This is a way to show caustion with POUR + INFINITIF (infinitif passé in this case because the cause - the theft - already happened).; When you use a verb + ing in english (e.g. swimming + having) it often translates to infinitif passé in french.,vocabulary
for example,par exemple ('par-ex-ompl') OR notemment; Par exemple is abbreviated as ex: (not e.g.). Notemment is more idiomatic and can also be translated as 'including...'.; Preposition PAR (= by way of) explains causation in terms of the manner or the place. POUR expains causation in terms of goals.,vocabulary

How do you ask: Is it X?,Est-ce X? ('ehsss'); Remember that Est-ce (Is it?) is the inverse of C'est (It is.) So... It is difficult. = C'est difficile. Is it difficult? = Est-ce difficile?.; You construct the simple question by replacing C'est with Est-ce.,questions
How do you ask: Was it X?,Est-ce que c'était X?; It is possible to ask this with simple inversion: Était-ce X? (akin to Est-ce X? au présent) but this is very bizarre in French. Do not use it.

How do you ask: Is that X?,Est-ce que c'est X?; Literally: Is it that it is X?; e.g. Is that bizarre? = Est-ce que c'est bizarre?,questions

How do you ask: What is ...?,Generally: Qu'est-ce que ...? ('kes-kuh'); This is always followed by subject + verb. Do not invert the order when forming the question.; NB: Do not always use QUE to translation 'what'.

What is this and how do you pronounce it?: Qu'est-ce que...?,The whole thing is pronounced 'kes-kuh'. It is a contraction of QUE + EST-CE QUE.; This is generally how you ask: What is...? The response is NOT yes/no. You are asking for a noun.; NB: In french it matters whether you are asking for a subject (QUE) or a direct object (QUOI).,questions

What are you doing this evening? (formal and informal),Qu'est-ce que vous faites / tu fais su soir?,questions
How do you ask: Which is ...?,Quel est...? ('kel-ay-...') but it adapts to the gender and number of what you are asking about so there are four possbilities: Quel? (masc sing) Quelle? (fem sing) Quels? (masc plural) Quelles? (fem plural); All four forms are pronounced exactly the same: 'kel'.,questions
What is your (informal) profession?,Quelle est ta profession?; Use QUELLE because profession is feminine and singular.,questions
What kind/type is it? (e.g. type of car or dance or music),Quel genre est-il? ('kel-jon-ray-til'); Use QUEL because genre is masculine and singular.,questions
What type of jackets do you have?,Quel genre de veste avez-vous? OR Vous avez quel genre de veste?; If you use Quel then you have to invert the subject verb; OR you can make a statement (subject + verb) and use intonation to make it a question,questions
of this type,tel... This is an adjective with the following forms: tel/telle/tels/telles,vocabulary
an outfit of this type,un telle tenue; Tel is an adjective that adapts to the noun it modifies: tel/telle/tels/telles.,vocabulary
What color is the dress?,DE quelle couleur est la robe?; Use DE QUEL instead of QUEL because we use a preposition in english: What is the color OF the dress? The presence of the preposition in english indicates that we need to use DE QUEL... in French.,questions
What colors are you (formal) wearing?,DE quelles couleurs vous portez?; Use QUELLES because couleures is plural and feminine.; couleur is pronounced 'kool-oor' like heurre,questions

When is ...? / When is it?,Quand est ...? ('kon-ah-...')/ Quand est-ce? ('kon-tes'); NB: quand is a general word for 'when' whether you are making a question or a statement. lorsque is a slightly more formal word that you can use instead of quand.,questions
When do you (informal / formal)...?,Quand est-ce que tu/vous...?; NB: Quand ends in consonant sound (D) and est-ce begins with vowel sound (E) so you must link the words when speaking ('koh-Des-kuh'...),questions

How many years?,Combien D'années?; Use combien for how many and how much. Use combien + generic DE because you are asking about a quantity of something. Use années instead of ans because the quantity is indefinite/inexact.,questions

What are the three levels of speaking/writing in French? How are questions formed at each level?,1) soutenu: formal e.g. Use inversion to form a question.  2) passe partout (aka courant): can be used anywhere in both formal and informal situations. e.g. Use Est-ce que... to form a question. No inversion.  3) familiére: informal. Only use with close friends. e.g. Use quoi to form a question. No inversion.,questions
What are three ways to ask a closed (yes/no) question?,1) soutenu (formal with inversion): VERB + DASH + SUBJECT ? (e.g. Vas-tu? = Are you going?); Often uses a dash between verb and subject with added T for pronunciation as needed.; 2) Passe partout (aka interrogative/courante): EST-CE QUE + SUBJECT + VERB? Remember that a noun ALWAYS follow EST-CE QUE. No inversion of subject/verb when using est-ce que! (e.g. Est-ce que tu vas? = Are you going?); 3) Familiére (aka affirmative): SUBJECT + VERB?  You must use intonation to make it sound like a question. Only use this structure with friends in very casual situations.,questions
What are three ways to ask an open (not a yes/no question)?,It is the same three options as closed questions. To make the question open we add an interrogative word (que + quand + où + pourquoi + comment...). Add it at the beginning of the closed soutenue and passe partout formats. Add it at the end of the familiére format.; 1) Soutenue: MOT INTERROGATIVF + VERB + DASH + SUBJECT ? e.g. Où vas-tu? = Where are you going? 2) Passe Partout: MOT INTERROGTIF + EST-CE QUE (not qu'est-ce que) + SUBJECT + VERB? e.g. Où est-ce que tu vas? = Where are you going?; 3) Familiére: SUBJECT + VERB + MOT INTERROGATIF? e.g. Tu vas où? = You go where?,questions
How many times have you listened to it? Ask in two ways: soutenu + passe partout.,Soutenue: Combien de fois l'as-tu écouté ?; Passe partout: Combien de fois est-ce que tu l'as écouté ?; When you need a specific interrogative word (e.g. comment + quand + où) simply add it to the beginning of the soutenue (inversion) and passe partout (est-ce que - not qu'est-ce que) formats.,questions
How did you get home?,Comment (est-ce que) tu es rentré(e) ?; To use an interrogative word (e.g. comment + quand + où) in a question simply add it to the beginning of the soutenue (inversion) and passe partout (est-ce que - not qu'est-ce que) formats.; You can see that 'est-ce que' actually becomes optional. If you omit it you have the familiar form (using intonation).,questions
How do you know whether to use QUE or QUOI when asking 'what' in a question?,In french it matters whether you are asking for a subject (use QUE) or an object (use QUOI). Often qoui is preceded by a preposition either because the verb requires it or because the object is part of a prepositional phrase.; An example with QUE: What is the thing on the table? = QU'est-ce que la chose sur la table ? 'What' is the subject that is doing the action (being on the table).; An example with QUOI: You found what? = Tu as trouvé quoi ? 'Tu' is the subject. 'What' is the object.; Ultimately it depends on how you structure the question. e.g. passe partout (Qu'est-ce...) or familiére (subject + verb + object ...using intonation).,questions
What would you say? Ask this in three ways: soutenue + passe partout + familiére.,1) soutenu (inversion): Que dirais-tu? QUE = what when using inversion to ask a question. 2) passe partout (qu'est-ce que): Qu'est-ce que tu dirais? 3) familiére (quoi): Tu dirais quoi?,questions
What is it? Ask this in three ways: soutenu + passe partout + familiére.,1) soutenu: Qu'est-ce? (rarely heard); 2) passe partout: Qu'est-ce que c'est? ('kes-kuh-say') literally means: What it is? Use QUE (instead of quoi) becuase the 'what' represents a subject (not the object).; 3) Familiére: C'est quoi? Literally: It is what? 'What' is the object and être does not require a preposition so use QUOI.,questions
What is it like? (when you are asking someone to describe a location etc.),DE QUOI ça a l'air?; Literally: 'Of what' is it like? Use DE QUOI because the 'what' is an object (not the subject) and the verb (avoir l'air de...) requires a preposition.,questions
What is it about? (like when you see someone with a book and you are curious what it is about) Ask this in three ways: soutenu + passe partout + familiére., 1) soutenu: De quoi s'agit-il? This is rarely used. DE QUOI because the 'what' is an object and S'AGIR requires DE.; 2) passe partout: Qu'est-ce que ça raconte?; 3) familiére: Ça raconte quoi? QUOI without preposition because the 'what' is a direct object of the verb.,questions

What did you do last month?; Ask this using an extra pronom tonique for emphasis,Qu'est-ce que tu as fait le mois dernière` toi?; In French we place elements on relief (mettre en relief) to emphasize them. Use pronoms tonique to emphasize a person in this way. We want to emphasize TU. So use the pronom tonique TOI.,questions
I don't know what to do.,Je ne sais pas quoi faire.; Use QUOI (instead of que) because the 'what' is an object (not the subject). There is no preposition before quoi because the verb (savoir) does not require a preposition.,pronouns
I didn't know what to do. vs I didn't know what I had to do.,Je ne savais pas QUOI faire. vs Je ne savais pas CE QUE je devais faire.; In the first phrase 'what' is a direct object of the verb so we use QUOI. In the second phrase the 'what' is actually a subordinate clause so we need a conjunction like CE QUE to represent an antecedent ('what') that is totally absent / undefined.,pronouns
I know something. + You know what?,Je sais quelque chose (direct object). + Tu sais QUOI (direct object) ?; Use QUOI (instead of que) when asking the question because the 'what' is an object (not the subject) in this format.

I think the worst. + You think what?,Je pense AU pire (à + indirect object). + Tu penses À QUOI (à + indirect object) ?; Use QUOI (instead of que) when asking the question because the 'what' is an object (not the subject) in this format.

I fear the bear. + You fear what?,J'ai peur DE l'ours (de + indirect object). + Tu as peur DE QUOI (de + indirect object) ?; Use QUOI (instead of que) when asking the question because the 'what' is an object (not the subject) in this format. We need the preposition DE because the verb (AVOIR PEUR DE...) requires it.,questions
What are you thinking about?,Vous pensez à quoi? or À quoi pensez vous?; Literally: Of what are you thinking? 'You' is the subject. 'What' is the object.; Use À (instead of DE) because PENSER À means to think about something / to have it on the mind. (PENSER DE means to have an opinion about something.); Use À QUOI (instead of ce que) because the object (what) can stand on its own.,pronouns
What do you think of it? (e.g. after you have spoken and you are asking for someone's opinion),Qu'est-ce que vous EN pensez? OR Qu'est-ce que tu EN penses?; Use pronom EN because we mean PENSER DE (to have an opinion about something) - instead of PENSER À (to think about something / to have it on the mind).,questions
Do you think the same?,Penses-tu la même chose? / Est-ce que tu penses la même chose?; Alternative: Est-ce que tu LE penses aussi?,questions
What's up?,Quoi de neuf?; Literally: 'Of what' is new? Use DE QUOI because the 'what' is an object (not the subject) and requires a preposition.; Neuf means 'new' in some circumstances.,questions

What is in the water? + I know what is in the water.,Qu'est-ce qu'il y a dans l'eau ? + Je sais ce qu'il y a dans l'eau.; When asking an open (not a yes/no) question we use QU'EST-CE QUE. To change an open question into a statment: qu'est-ce que becomes CE QUE.,questions

Use the soutenu (inversion) form to ask: Is he orange? + Is the cat orange?,Est-il orange? (simple inversion when subject is a pronoun) + Le chat est-il orange? (insert pronoun to enable inversion and place the proper noun at the beginning of the question),questions
What is a euphonic T? When do you use it?,euphonic T = a T that is inserted between words to aid in pronunciation. The major use case is asking a question using inversion (soutenu). If the verb ends in a vowel then you insert the T so that the pronoun subject is easier to pronounce. e.g. Does he have a dog? = A-t-il un chien? because we cannot write A-il.,questions
Do we need a cat? Use inversion/soutenu to ask the question. Use on (instead of nous).,A-t-on besoin d'un chat?; Explanation: We need a cat. = On a besoin d'un chat. Using inversion: A-on besoin d'un chat. But we cannot hyphenate two vowels together. So we add the euphonic T to aid in pronunciation: A-t-on; This happens when we use inversion to ask a question and the conjugated verb ends in a vowel (which is often the case in passé composé).,questions
Does she speak german? Use inversion/soutenu to ask the question.,Parle-t-elle allemand?; Explanation: She speaks German. = Elle parle allemand. Using inversion: Parle-elle allemand.

So we add the euphonic T to aid in pronunciation: A-t-il; This happens when we use inversion to ask a question and the conjugated verb ends in a vowel (which is often the case in passé composé).,questions
Did the tiger eat the bird? Use inversion/soutenu to ask the question.,Le tigre a-t-il mangé l'oiseau?; The tiger ate the bird. = Le tigre a mangé l'oiseau. Using inversion: Le tigre a-il mangé l'oiseau. But we cannot hyphenate two vowels together. So we add the euphonic T to aid in pronunciation: Le tigre a-t-il; This happens when we use inversion to ask a question and the conjugated verb ends in a vowel (which is often the case in passé composé).,questions
You (formal) watched the movie. + Did you watch the movie? (using soutenu/inversion),Vous avez regardé le film. + Avez-vous regardé le film?; When using inversion and the verb is passé composé you hyphenate with the auxiliary (not the past participle).,questions
Is the chicken good? Ask this using passe partout form.,Est-ce qu'il est bon le poulet?; NB: The QUE and subject IL get pushed together with apostrophe to avoid two vowels together. qu'il ('keel') is pronounced as a single syllable. Always ignore an apostrophe for pronunciation.,questions
Specify pronunciation of: Quand est-ce que tu vas? + Quand es tu libre? Explain the difference.,Quand‿est-ce que tu vas? ('qan-Tuh-skuh-too-va') + Quand es tu libre? ('qan-Ehs-too-leebr'); Add a T liaison between QUAND and EST-CE. But there is never a liaison between QUAND and a VERB (e.g. es). Pronounce the two words separately without liaison in the second case.,pronunciation

When answering a question about 'how long'... It's been 3 weeks that....,Ça/Cela fait trois semaines que....; Ça fait is a really common and casual way of expressing that something has been happening.

It's been 5 years since I came to France.,Ça/Cela fait 5 ans QUE je suis en France.; Ça/Cela fait X que... works like depuis.

It's been 5 years since I've been to Brazil.,Ça/Cea fait 5 ans QUE je NE suis PAS allé(e) au Brésil.; Ça/Cela fait X que... generally works like depuis.

I was 19 years old when I started living alone.,J'AVAIS (imparfait) 19 ans quand j'ai commencé (passé composé) à vivre seul.; The first phrase is in imparfait because it describes state of being/setting. The second phrase is passé composé because it describes a discreet action.,vocabulary

usually + ...per/as usual,d'habitude + ...comme d'habitude; au quotidien = on a regular basis,vocabulary

despite / in spite of (something),malgré (quelque chose); e.g. Malgré les problèmes...,vocabulary
Despite high unemployment` the economy is dynamic.,Malgré le chômage élevé` l'économie est dynamique.; Like in English malgré (despite) must be followed by a noun. If that noun is complicated and needs explanation then you can use a relative phrase to maintain the structure while providing more information: Malgré le chômage` qui est élevé`...,vocabulary
regardless,quand même OR malgré tout (= despite everything); These can both mean regardless or anyway when you are making a contrast.; Quand même is a french expression. The closest literal translation is 'all the same'.,vocabulary
He did it regardless/anyway.,Il l'a quand même fait.; quand même is the correct phrase to use in this case. If instead you want to use the word 'anyway' to make a conversational bridge then use the word bref instead.,vocabulary
even when...,même quand; It's a literal translation.; Be careful because if you reverse the order it means something different: quand même = regardless.,vocabulary
even though...,malgré que... + phrase (triggers subjonctif); e.g. Je suis venu malgré que je n’aie pas vraiment le temps. = I came even though I really don’t have time.; As in English the phrases can be inverted. The verb following malgré que must be conjugated in the subjonctif mood.,vocabulary

What does pourtant mean?,It is a conjonctive (conjunction) used to contrast two ideas. So it can mean yet + even though + nevertheless + but even so.,vocabulary
anyway... (conversational bridge),bref... OR tout de même... OR m'enfin bon...; Both of these work when you are just making a conversational bridge. But if you mean something like: He did it regardless. Then you should use quand même or malgré.; NB: tout de même is a fixed french expression that uses TOUT regardless of the number/gender of the antecedent to which it refers.,vocabulary
actually... (conversational bridge),en fait ('ohn-fehT'). Pronunciation of final T is optional in this case but it's helpful to pronounce the T so that en fait (adverb with T) can be differentiated from on fait (verb without T). Never pronounce the T when fait is used as a verb. e.g. On fait du pain. ('ohn-fay'),conversation
basically... (conversational bridge),en gros,conversation
of course,bien sûr,conversation
obvious + obviously,évident(e)/clair(e) + évidemment; Obviously! = Évidemment! or C'est évident! or Clairement! or C'est clair!,vocabulary

I don't know about the rest.,Je ne sais pas POUR le reste (or le suite = the following).,conversation
Absolutely!,tout À fait;  NB: This is a fixed french expression that uses TOUT regardless of the number/gender of what it refers to.,vocabulary
Absolutely not!,pas DU tout! (literally: not at all) OR Absolument pas! OR Ça va pas non. OR Surtout pas.; Ça va pas no is very idiomatic. It is spoken in an understated way but the meaning is something like 'you must be crazy'.; PAS is an adjective (not an adverb) in this case. So we do not generalize the object. DU tout remains instead of changing to DE tout.,vocabulary
What are the four forms of 'all'. Specify pronounciation.,tout ('too' sing masc) + toute ('toot' sing fem) + tous ('too' pl masc) + toutes ('toot' pl fem); For pronunciation you really only need to know if you are in a masculine 'too' or feminine 'toot' situation.; TOUS (masculine plural) is pronounced 'too' when used as an adjective: tous les jours. But it is pronounced 'toos' when used as pronoun: Bonjour à tous!,vocabulary
When is TOUS pronounced 'toos'?,TOUS (masculine plural) is pronounced 'too' when used as an adjective: tous les jours. It is pronounced 'toos' when used as pronoun: Bonjour à tous!,pronunciation
everyone / everybody,TOUT le monde; Tout le monde is a singular subject (same as in English).; Use TOUT because le monde is masculine singular. You should also use the singular form of a verb when tout le monde is the subject.; Alternative: les uns envers les autres = an expression meaning between people (like 'one and all'),vocabulary
everything,tout (generally); Tout is a singular subject (same as in English).; If it is unclear exactly what things you are referencing then defer to the singular masculine form (TOUT). This means you use the singular form of a verb when TOUT is the subject.; But if you are referring to some group of things already mentioned than you need to select from tout/toute/tous/toutes depending on the number and gender of the 'everything'.,vocabulary
Everything is fine.,TOUT va bien.; Use the masculine singular version (tout) when you mean everything in general. This also requires that we use the singular form of a verb (va not vont).,vocabulary

He is all/completely alone.,Il est TOUT seaul.; 'all' is an adverb that modifies a masculine singular adjective (seul). So we select TOUT.; NB: We always use TOUT as an adverb in the masculine cases regardless singular/plural and regardless of what letter the adjective (that is modifies starts with).,vocabulary
She is completely content.,Elle est TOUTE contente.; 'completely' is an adverb that modifies a feminine singular adjective (contente). Select TOUTE in this case.; NB: If the adjective being modified starts with a vowel or silent H then change TOUTE to TOUT.,vocabulary
She is entirely/completely emotional.,Elle est TOUT émue.; 'entirely/completely' is an adverb that modifies a feminine singular adjective (émue). Normally we would select TOUTE for that case. But émue starts with a vowel so we use TOUT instead.,vocabulary

In that case we use TOUT when singular and TOUTS when plural (regardless of gender - which is ambiguous).; Do not use 'Ce sont' to mean 'They are' or 'There are'. If you use CE or ÇA as a subject then it should be treated as a singular subject: C'est (not Ce sont).,vocabulary

They (all women) are at the party.,TOUTES sont à la fête.; 'all' is bieng used as a pronoun here. It stands for something that is feminine plural so select TOUTES.,vocabulary
all of us + all of them (men) + all of them (women),nous tous + eux tous + elles toutes; The plural pronouns of 'all' (tous + toutes) are often used with pronoms toniques.,vocabulary

I went out every day (in a week). + I went out all week long.,Je sortais TOUS les jours. + Je suis sortie TOUTE la semaine.; The first statement is habitual so use imparfait. Each of the days is a whole day. You are talking about a frequency (more than a duration) so use JOUR instead of JOURNÉE.; The second statement is not habitual (even though it means the same thing). So use passé composé. The week is the duration within which you went out.,vocabulary
every two weeks,toutes les deux semaines; Use toutes because semaines is plural and feminine.,vocabulary
every Monday,le lundi OR tous les lundis (add S to make plural);Use TOUS as an adjective ('too' instead of 'toos') because 'every' is an adjective and the nouns it modifies are masculine plural.; dimanche = on Sunday. le dimanche = on every Sunday. à dimanche = see you on Sunday.,vocabulary

one of them,l'un d'entre eux (masculine) + l'une d'entre elles (feminine); NB: There is no DE preposition after ENTRE.,vocabulary
one of my favorites,un de mes préféréS; -és because 'favorites' is plural and assumed masculine - it is not explicit what kind of group we are talking about.,vocabulary
one of my favorite dishes + one of my favorite restaurants,un de mes plats préféréS + un de mes restaurants préféréS; You can use favoris instead of préférés but it is less idiomatic.,vocabulary
The kichen is my favorite room.,La cuisine est sa pièce préférée.; -ée because la pièce (room) is singular feminine.,vocabulary
her favorite holiday,son jour férié préféré,vocabulary
a thing,une chose ('shows') OR un truc (slang),vocabulary
lots of things + many people like me,beaucoup de choses + beaucoup de personnes comme moi; NB: When speaking the consonants are pushed together and you drop a lot of the verbs: 'bow-koo-Tshowz' and 'bow-koo-Tper-sohn'.

SOME stress + SOME horses,quelque stress (singular masculine) + quelqueS chevaux (plural); In this case 'some' is an adjective that modifies the singular 'stress' and the plural 'horses'.

through,It depends on context.; 1) PAR (= by way of) is less aggresive. e.g. Je regarde PAR la fenêtre. = I look through the window. Je passe PAR le quartier. = I pass by the neighborhood. 2) À TRAVERS is more aggressive with emphasis on crossing or literally going through one thing in order to get to another thing. e.g. I throw the ball through the window. = Je lance la balle à travers la fenêtre.; TRAVERSER generally means to cross through something but it can mean to travel across (e.g. to cross a river on a ferry or to cross the road on foot).,vocabulary
to go by (something) + to go through (something),PASSER + PAR + noun (e.g. Je passe par le quartier. = I pass by the neighborhood.) + TRAVERSER + noun (e.g. Je traverse le quartier en voiture. = I drove through the neighborhood.); NB: When you use TRAVERSER you are emphasizing the action of crossing something / going through it (e.g. to cross the road).

The dog is to the left of the person.,Le chien est à guache de la personne.,vocabulary
The person is standing to the left of the dog.,Le personne est debout à guache du chien.; Watch out: In french this means that the person is standing to the dog's left - not the left that is the perspective of the viewer.,vocabulary
where she stands (on that issue),où elle en est (literally: where she is on it); Alternatively you could spell out the object of the phrase: où elle est sur cette question; Use simply être. You cannot use verbs like rester or être debout (to stand) to describe a person's view on an issue (as we do in English).,vocabulary
between + between X and Y,entre + entre X et Y; Entre is the entire preposition. There is no DE following it. e.g. Entre toi et moi (between you and me). NOT entre de toi...,vocabulary
I worked 4 years total as a waitress between other jobs.,J'ai travaillé 4 ans au total comme serveuse souvent entre d'autres emplois.; NB: Use 'souvent' instead of 'beaucoup de fois' because it is much more idiomatic.,vocabulary
among,parmi; Parmi is used to indicate something that occurs among a sub-group. e.g. La diminution apparaît plus forte parmi les élèves pauvres. = The decrease appears stronger among poor students.; Parmi is less exclusionary than entre. If you are making a choice or describing an activity that is strictly limited to the sub-group then use entre instead of parmi. e.g. une dispute entre frères = an argument among/between brothers,vocabulary
in + inside,dans (preposition meaning 'in') + dedans (adverb meaning 'inside'),vocabulary

idiomatic way to say: I'm working on it. I'm on top of it.,Je travaille dessus.; Literally 'I work on top.',vocabulary

under (at a short distance and possibly hidden); Specify the pronunciation.,sous; Pronounced with the low-pitched 'oo' like being punched in the stomach. No ending consonant or sound.; NB: sous does not necessarily imply that the two objects are in contact. That is different from sur which does imply contact.,vocabulary
below and not touching (at some distance),au-dessous de OR en dessous de (same meaning); NB: above (not touching) looks very similar with one letter difference: au-dessus de,vocabulary
The apple is under the table. + The floor is below the ceiling.,La pomme est sous la table. + Le sol est au-dessous de la plafond.,vocabulary
It's 'underneath'.,C'est dessous.,vocabulary
underground,souterrain(e) = adjective; le souterrain = the underground,vocabulary
at the top + at the bottom, en haut ('ohn-o') + en bas; NB: en haut does not have a liaison so the N falls in the first syllable 'ohn-o'.; Alternatives for the top: le sommet (the summit) + la cime (the tip top - like of a tree),vocabulary
sweating,transpiré(e); Alternative: en‿eau. This uses a liaison so the N is pronounced in the second syllable ('oh-no').,vocabulary

How do you say that you are waiting downstairs/outside of someone's building (when meeting up)?,Je t'attends en bas (de l'immeuble).,vocabulary
I went up the stairs. + I went upstairs.,Use the verb MONTER with auxiliare être (to ascend). Je suis monté(e). + Je suis allé(e) à l'étage.; Monter with auxiliare être (and NO object) = to go up / to take oneself up. Monter with auxiliare avoir (and COD) = to take upstairs (or assemble) some object (COD).; Do not use an object if you mean to go up. e.g. Je monte. = I go upstairs. Je monte les escaliers. = I assemble / put up the stairs.,verbs
I went down the stairs. + I went downstairs.,Use the verb DESCENDRE with auxiliare être (to descend). J'ai descendu les marches. + J'ai descendu les étages. OR Je suis descendu.; NB: descendre uses avoir as the auxiliary when you have a direct object. But is uses être when the verb is followed by nothing or a prepositional phrase.,verbs
I got on the train. + I got off the train.,Use MONTER/DESCENDRE with auxiliare être for these cases: Je suis monté(e) DANS le train. + Je suis déscendu(e) DU train.; Both require prepositions after the verb because if there was a COD then that would change the meaning of the verb. e.g. Je monte (no COD). = I go up/upstairs.  Je monte le train (COD). = I put up (or assemble) the train.  Je monte DANS le train. = I get (go up) on the train.,verbs
The sun sets.,Use the verb DESCENDRE (goes down). Le soleil descend.,verbs
to go back down + to go back up,redescendre + remonter; For both of these cases: Use auxiliare être and do not add a COD (because you want to indicate the state of being). If you say: Je remonte la montagne (COD). = I put the mountain back up. So you must simply say: Je remonte. = I go back up. You can add a prepositional phrase (e.g. sur la montagne) to indicate on what you are ascending.,verbs
high + low,haut(e) + bas/basse,vocabulary
backwards (in terms of movement or direction),There is no direct translation that is an adjective. Options: 1) de la fin au début (literally from front to back) 2) use the verb régresser (e.g. l'économie régresse = the economy moves backward / regresses / de-evolves),vocabulary
upside down,à l'envers; This can be used to mean backwards but it is not a direct translation.,vocabulary

the previous question + the following question,la question précédente + la question suivante,vocabulary
the month before + the week before,le mois précédent + la semaine précédente,vocabulary
the next question + the next month,Generally: la question suivante + le mois prochain; Whether you use suivant(e) or prochain(e) depends on tense and context. Use suivant (or d'apres) in the past tense. e.g. the next question that he asked. Use procain(e) only when projecting into the future. e.g. The party will be next month.; If a list or series has already been established then use suivant(e) to indicate the following item. If you are talking about the next time something happens in the future then use prochain(e).,vocabulary
Specify the pronunciation of prochain vs prochaine.,The last syllable of the masculine prochain is super nasal and the N is silent. This is very different from the feminine prochaine which is quick / non-nasal and the N is pronounced.,pronunciation
the last question + the last month,la dernière question + le mois dernier; Use dernier/derniére for both cases. This adjective is irregular in that is is placed before the noun instead of after.,vocabulary
in the next year + in the next years,dans l'année prochaine + dans les prochaines années; The adjective changes places when the noun is made plural!,vocabulary
at the end of his/her studies,à la fin DE ses études,vocabulary
I will stop the course in 2 weeks.,J'arrêterai le cours AU BOUT DE deux semaines.; au bout de... is the best phrase to use for 'at the end of...',vocabulary

at the back (of a photo or piece of furniture),au fond; e.g. at the back of the armoire = au fond de l'armoire,vocabulary
the ending,la terminaison,vocabulary
definite articles for masculine + feminine + plural nouns,le/la/les; If the noun starts with a vowel then you replace le/la with l' and pronounce the verb as if it starts with L - ignore the apostrophe when speaking,vocabulary

femine masculine plural,féminin masculin pluriel,vocabulary
How do you determine which french nouns formed from verbs (e.g. ouvrir to ouverture) are feminine or masculine based on suffix?,Masculine nouns end in -age OR -ment. Feminine nouns end in -(a)tion OR -(s)ion OR xion OR -ade OR -ure.; Ending in E is not helpful because there are feminine and masculine nouns that end in E.,vocabulary
How do you determine which french nouns formed from adjectives (e.g. large to largesse) are feminine or masculine based on suffix?,Feminine nouns end in -(i)té OR -eur OR -ise OR -ance OR -ence OR -esse.; It is common that nouns formed from adjectives are feminine because often the noun is formed by selecting the feminine form of the adjective and then adding a suffix.,vocabulary
When should there be an apostrophe instead of spelling out le/la?,when the noun starts with a vowel OR when the second letter is a vowel and the first letter is not pronouned (e.g. h); l'académie instead of la académie; l'ordinateur instead of le ordinateur; l'hôtel,vocabulary
Aside from a definite article (the) when do you use le/la/l'?,These are also the pronouns for ils/elle when he/she/it is the direct object of a verb; e.g. I read it. = Je le lis. (I + it masculine + read conjugated in present tense),vocabulary

the nationality + the citizenship,la nationalité + la citoyenneté,vocabulary
U.S. nationality + French nationality,la nationalité états-unienne + la nationalité française; The adjective for 'American' when you want to specify United States: états-unien(e) OR étasunien(e),vocabulary
What is your nationality?,Quelle est votre/ta nationalité?; nationalité is feminine so Quelle and votre/ta must agree with it.,conversation
I am American.,Je suis américain (m) / américainne (f).; the 'n' is pronounced very lightly and only in the feminine version.; Names of countries are capitalized in French. Names of nationalities and languages are not capitalized in French. But when you use a noun that refers to a person then you capitalize: La Française... = the french woman...,conversation
You are French.,Tu es français (m) / française (f).; masculine pronounced 'fran-say'; feminine pronounced 'fran-seZ'; Names of countries are capitalized in French. Names of nationalities and languages are not capitalized in French. But when you use a noun that refers to a person then you capitalize: La Française... = the french woman...,conversation
a french man + a french woman + the french people,le Français + la Française + les Français; One of the only times that you capitalize these kinds of descriptors is when you use them as a noun that refers to a person. Otherwise français(e) is an adjective that is not capitalized. e.g. Il est français. Elle parle français.,conversation
How is the name of a language related to nationality?,There are masculine and feminine versions of every nationality. The language is always the masculine version.; e.g. Il est allemand. Elle est allemande. Elle parle allemand.; 'allemand' is how you translate German when you mean the language.; BUT the word for language is feminine (la langue). So if you want to say the entire phrase 'the german language' then it is a feminine noun with a feminine adjective: la langue allemande.,conversation
a french/argentine passport,un passport français/argentin; Un visa is also masculine.,conversation
the confirmation of citizenship in France (if you were not born there),la naturalisation; alternative: la acquisition de la nationalité,vocabulary

I do not come from Paris.,Je ne viens pas de Paris.; To make a statement negative: Add NE directly after the subject (pronouns never come between the subject and NE). Then add PAS after the conjugated verb (or the auxiliary in the case of passé composé).,conversation
I do not live in Berlin.,Je n'habite pas à Berlin.; If the verb starts with a vowel or the first pronounced sound is a vowel (no 'h' in france) then use N' instead of NE.,conversation
I have family in Sweden.,J'ai de la famille en Suède.; AVOIR + 'de la famille' is an idiomatic way of expressing that some of your family is in a location.,conversation
I don't see well.,Je ne vois pas bien.; Adding pas to an adjective totally negates it and makes it negative instead of neutral. e.g. pas parfait = the opposite of perfect; Remember that when you use negation NE is optional especially when spoken.,conversation
I speak English.,Je parle ('shhhhhhparl') anglais. OR Je parle en anglais. Either is correct - like in english (I speak English. OR I speak in English.); NB: In french we always use an article in front of noun. Speaking a language (using the verb parler) is the only exception. When using parler we do not say/write... Je parle l'anglais. But any other time you use the name of a language (or any other noun) then you always add an article in front of it.,conversation
I do not speak Mandarin.,Je ne parle pas mandarin.; Names of countries are capitalized in French. Names of nationalities and languages are not capitalized in French.,conversation
I speak a little Spanish + French + German.,Je parle ('shhhhhparl') un peu espagnol et français et allemand.; JE is pronounced slowly as a long 'shhhh' sound. But you must avoid making it a separate syllable. It's not 'shuh-parl'. It's 'shhhhhparl'.,conversation
a french class + a dance class, un cours de français + un cours ('koohr') de dance;  NB: cours looks plural ending in S but it is singular.; Do not use 'classe' for this. Une classe refers to class heirarchy (e.g. 1st class) or the specific time that you are in school.,vocabulary
I go to french class. + I take a french class.,Je vais EN cour de français. + Je prends ('shhhhhpruh') un cours de français.; Do not use à for going to class. That is used for going to a city etc. - somewhere you visit.,vocabulary
a french A2 class,un cours du A2; 'french' is understood,vocabulary
a class + a race + a yard; Specify pronunciation.,All of these words sound similar but have different meanings.; un cours ('koohr') = a class / a course of action / an errand; une course ('coors') = a race; une cour ('coor') = a yard / a courtyard; la compétition de course à pied = the foot race,vocabulary
a messenger / a courier,un corsier,vocabulary

of high quality,une qualité élevée OR De haute qualité,vocabulary
a class at a good level (for me),un cours À un bon niveau,vocabulary
at most + at least,(tout) au plus + au moins,vocabulary
at least one month; Specify the pronunciation.,au moins (very nasal 'mwah') un mois (non-nasal 'mwah'); Literally the only difference between the sound of moins and mois is the nasality of the vowel. Adding the N to the OI changes it from a sound in the mouth to a sound in the nasal cavity.,pronunciation
some + several,certaines + plusieurs,vocabulary
When some people... and other people...,Quand certaines personnes... et d'autres personnes...,vocabulary
a bit + a little bit,un peu + un petit peu; These are quantities so they are always followed by the generic preposition DE/D' and without any article. e.g. un peu d'information (NOT des informations),vocabulary
a lot / many,beaucoup; If you use beaucoup as a quantity (e.g. a lot of fish / many fish) then you must add the generic preposition DE/D' (without articles)between beaucoup and the object of the preposition (e.g. beaucoup de poisson). Omit articles completely because we are expressing a quantity.; If you use beaucoup to modify a verb (e.g. We drank a lot.) then it is an adverb and must come before the verb (e.g. Nous avons beaucoup bu.).,vocabulary
There are a lot of hospitals and cliniques in this city.,Il y a beaucoup D'hôpitaux et DE cliniques à cette ville.; When there are two or more nouns (hospitals and cliniques) that refer to the same quantity (many / a lot of) then all of the nouns must be prefaced by the generic DE.,vocabulary
in many cases...,dans de nombreux cas...; numerous = nombreux (pl masc) /  nombreuses (pl fem); This works like beaucoup in that it triggers the generic DE (like a quantity).; Both of these are plural adjectives. There is no way for this adjective to be singular.; You can only use the feminine form (nombreuses) if ALL of the items are feminine.,vocabulary
How do you pronounce: Il y a ('eeyah') cinq chaises.,In conversation Il Y A is shortened to 'eeyah'.,pronunciation
not much (like when someone asks you what you have been doing and there is little to report),pas grand chose OR rien d'especial; e.g. Je n'ai pas fait grand chose. / J'ai fait rien d'especial.; Do not use the phrase 'pas beaucoup' - this does not make sense in french.,vocabulary
nothing extravagant,rien d'extravagant,vocabulary
too much + too much money,trop ('troh') + trop D'argent; (like beaucoup) Trop is a quantity and it can be used on it's own.; When used as a quantity then it is always followed by the generic DE (without articles).,vocabulary
There are too many of them.,Il y EN a trop.; When you specify of what there is too much then you use DE (e.g. trop de bouteilles). So when you do not specify the noun then you replace it with pronom EN.,vocabulary
extra; Specify pronunciation.,supplémentaire ('soo-play-mOH-tehr'); EN is a nasal 'ohn' sound but the N is silent.; e.g. une semaine supplémentaire = an extra week,vocabulary
so nice,tellement gentil(e) OR si gentil(e); Tellement and Si are the words that add emphasis like 'so' in english.; There is no preposition required if it proceeds an adjective or adverb.,vocabulary
so much (stuff),tellement DE choses OR si de choses; Tellement and Si are the words that add emphasis like 'so' in english.; You must add DE if it proceeds a noun. You must explicitly state the object (choses).,vocabulary
so many activities,tellement D'activités OR si d'activités; Tellement and Si are the words that add emphasis like 'so' in english.; You must add DE if it proceeds a noun. You must explicitly state the object (activités).,vocabulary
idiomatic way to say: She's very very (sooooo) nice etc. (any adjective).,Elle est tellement agréable.; Tellement is the word that adds emphasis like 'so' in english.,vocabulary
I do quite a lot of things.,Je fais pas mal de chose.; NB: 'pas mal' can mean not bad but it can also mean quite a lot.,vocabulary
She eats apples. Which word is assumed in English but cannot be assumed in French?,Elle mange DES pommes.; Partitive article is the name for the word that describes an uncountable or unknown (an undefined) quantity of something. (This is different from a defined or specified quantity like beaucoup DE X.) In this example the partitive article is 'some' and it is optional in English. She eats (some) apples. But in French the partitive article is never optional.,vocabulary
What are the partitive articles in French?,These are contractions of DE + an article (le/la/les) that are used in front of any undefined (or unknown or uncountable) quantity (e.g. J'ai DES frais. = I have strawberries.). The partitive articles are: du/d' (masculine) + de la/de l' (feminine) + des/d' (plural); This is different from the generic DE that is used for defined quantities (including lack of something). e.g. un peu D'huile + pas DE pommes.,vocabulary
Is there (some/any) coffee / onion?,Est-ce qu'il y a DU café / D'oignon?; When the quantity is undefined use the partitive articles (du / de la / des) instead of the generic de.; These nouns are masculine so we use DU. DU contracts to D' when the noun starts with a vowel.,vocabulary
Is there (some/any) meat / water?,Est-ce qu'il y a DE LA viande / DE L'eau?; When the quantity is undefined use the partitive articles (du / de la / des) instead of the generic de.; These nouns are feminine so we use DE LA. LA contracts to L' when the noun starts with a vowel.,vocabulary
Are there (some/any) lemons / onions?,Est-ce qu'il y a DES citrons / DES oignons?; When the quantity is undefined use the partitive articles (du / de la / des) instead of the generic de.; The gender of the plural noun does not matter. DES never contracts when the noun starts with a vowel because DES ends with a consonant.,vocabulary
the water,l'eau; eau is feminine. But la eau contracts to l'eau to avoid back-to-back vowels.; This is pronounced really strongly 'loh'.; -eau is pronounced as a strong 'oh' - like the words chateau and bateau.,vocabulary
two glasses of water (explain the pronunciation difference),deux verre D'eau; The O sound in deux is higher in the mouth. The O sound in d'eau is lower in the mouth; d'eau = DE + EAU. Use generic DE + EAU (instead of de + la + eau) because verre is a specified quantity.,vocabulary
The water is good. + a glass of water +  + I drink water.,These exhibit the three different ways to talk about water.; 1) L'eau est bonne. = The water is good. We are using the noun with its article (LA contracts to L').; 2) un verre d'eau = a glass of water. The glass is a specified quantity so we use the generic DE without anarticle. (DE contracts to D'.); 3) Je bois DE l'eau. = I drink water. The verb BOIRE is always followed by DE but it is not a quantity indicator. So you also have to give the object of the verb (water) it's article (la). DE + LA + EAU = de l'eau.,vocabulary
She eats a lot. + She ate a lot.; Note the location of 'beaucoup' in both cases.,Elle mange beaucoup. + Elle a beaucoup mangé.; If beaucoup describes the verb (manger) - as it does in both of these sentences - instead of the object (e.g. beaucoup DE frais)... then beaucoup must follow the conjugated portion of a verb. That means that 'beaucoup' falls between the two parts of passé composé in this case.,vocabulary
You (informal) eat a lot of apples.; Which preposition is required?,Tu manges beaucoup DE pommes.; 'A lot' in this case does not modify the verb (manger) here. It describes the quantity of apples (just like 'a kilo'). When quantity is specified use the generic DE (instead of partitive articles).,vocabulary
He ate a lot. + He ate a lot of apples.; Note the location of 'beaucoup' in both cases.,Il a BEAUCOUP mangé. + Il a mangé BEAUCOUP de pommes.; Both examples are passé composé so there are two parts to the verbs. In the first case BEAUCOUP modifies the verb (manger) so it must follow the conjugated portion of the two-part verb. In the second case BEAUCOUP modifies the object (pommes) so it must be placed after the entire verb.,vocabulary
There is coffee. + There is a box of coffee.,Il y a DU (de + le) café. + Il y a un carton DE café. (le café); The former has an undefined quantity so we use the partitive article DU (de + le) for the masculine café.; The latter has a defined quantity so we use generic DE.,vocabulary
There is salad + There is a pack of salad.,Il y a DE LA salade. + Il y a un paquet DE salade. (la salade); The former has an unspecified amount so we use the partitive article DE LA for the feminine salade.; The latter has a specified amount/quantity so we use generic DE.,vocabulary
There is a jar of strawberry jam.,Il y a un pot DE confiture de fraise. (la confiture); The quantity is defined so use the generic DE (or D').,vocabulary
There are a dozen cookies.,Il y a une douzaine DE biscuits. (les biscuits); The quantity is defined so use the generic DE (or D').,vocabulary
There is a handful of blueberries.,Il y a une poignée DE myrtilles (les myrtilles); The quantity is defined so use the generic DE (or D').,vocabulary
group words for: a dozen + a set of roughly 10 (tens),une douzaine ('doo-zehn') + une dizaine ('dee-zehn'); e.g. des dizaines de personnes = tens of individuals; If you want to communicate something that is greater than 10 and less than 100 then you could say: plusieurs dizaines = several tens (30 or 40 or 50 etc).,vocabulary

(When a negative adverb is used the quantity becomes defined so we must use generic DE.); Using PAS as a negative adjective: I see no cats. = Je NE vois PAS un chats. (The quantity is still undefined so we use partitive articles instead of generic DE.); NB: PAS should only be used as a negative adjective with nouns that can be quantified (e.g. cats). Use AUCUNE(E) for nouns that are difficult to quantify (e.g. happiness).,vocabulary

But we still need NE to complete the negation.; Aucun(e) is not an adverb so we do not have to add generic DE to the noun (avocats).,vocabulary
No vacations are too long.,PAS DE vacances NE sont (plural verb to match plural subject) trop longues.; When you really need to use a plural noun then you cannot use aucun(e) to replace or modify it because aucun(e) is always singular.

Explain how PERSONNE and RIEN are different from PAS and JAMAIS and PLUS (when negating a phrase).,PAS + JAMAIS + PLUS are all negative ADVERBS that are used (with NE) to negate a verb. But PERSONNE (no one) and RIEN (nothing) are negative PRONOUNS that mean quanity zero of humans (personne) or non-human things (rien). These pronouns simultaneously replace and negate a noun (not a verb).

nothing,rien ('ray-uhn') +  is the negative pronoun that means the absence of a thing (quantity zero of something not human). This includes the absence of some action. Because RIEN is a pronoun it can act as the subject or object of a verb - but not as an adverb. e.g. There are no pears. = Il n'y a PAS de poires.

But in passé composé (or any tense that uses an auxiliary) RIEN (like adverbs PAS/PLUS/JAMAIS) is placed directly after the auxiliary (the conjugated portion) and before the participe. PERSONNE acts more like a true pronoun in that it is placed after the participe.,vocabulary
He's not going to say anything.,Il NE vas RIEN dire.; RIEN is a negative pronoun (so it is not replacing PAS - an adverb). But we still need NE to complete the negation.; When there are two verbs (one conjugated + one infinitive) RIEN (like adverbs PAS/PLUS/JAMAIS) is placed directly after the conjugated verb. PERSONNE is different in that it acts more like a true pronoun - placed directly after the final verb (the infinitive).,vocabulary
There is nothing to do.,Il N'y a rien à faire.; RIEN is a negative pronoun. In this example it is being used as the object of the verb. To describe the absence of an action: RIEN À + INFINITIVE; Even though RIEN is a pronoun (instead of an adverb) we still need NE to complete the negation.,vocabulary
I don't want to do anything anymore.,Je ne veux plus rien faire.; Combining PLUS (negative adverb meaning 'no more') with RIEN (negative pronoun meaning 'nothing') creates this sentiment.,vocabulary
nothing else,rien d'autre ('ray-uhn-doot'),vocabulary
There was nothing else. + There was only this.,Il N'y avait RIEN d'autre. + Il N'y avait QUE cela.; Even though we are not using a negative adverb (like PAS) in either case... we still need NE to complete the meaning of RIEN (a negative pronoun) and QUE (works with NE to mean 'only').,vocabulary

more people + nobody anymore,plus DE personneS + plus personne; The presence or absence of DE and S (to make a plural) determines meaning.,vocabulary
He sees everyone. + He sees no one.,Il voit tout le monde. + Il NE voit PERSONNE.; Personne is a negative pronoun (not an adverb like PAS) so it can be the subject or object of a verb.

Because this is an adverb it does not need to adapt (in number and gender) to the verb it describes.;  meilleur/meilleure/meilleurs/meillures (better) are the adjectives to use as the comparator for bon/bonne/bons/bonnes (good). Because these are all adjectives they must adapt (in number and gender) to the nouns which they describe.; NB: Better and all of its transations are called comparators.,vocabulary

The generic pronom (le) in front of the verb is required because the verb EMPORTER must have a direct object (in addition to the prepositional phrase 'sur le...'). When the COD is not specified we use generic LE.,verbs
I was not drinking last night.,Je me suis abstenue de boire hier soir. OR Je me suis abstenue d'alcool hier soir.; The verb is S'ABSTENIR.,verbs
bad + poorly/badly,mal/mauvais (adjective) + mal (adverb); mal/mauvais is irregular in that it is placed before the noun that it describes.,vocabulary

Explain the two words that mean: worst,Use the same adverb or adjective that you would choose for 'worse'. And you must add an article (le/la/les) because 'the worst' is always a noun.; The two options: 1) LE PLUS MAL when you are describing someone/thing that is the worst at doing some verb. Adverbs do not adapt (in number and gender) to the verb. It is the opposite of le mieux (the best). 2) LE/LA/LES PIRE(S) are adjectives used to describe a noun - when some thing is 'the worst' of the group. Adjectives must adapt (in number and gender) to the noun they describe. These are the opposites of le meilleur / la meilleure / les meilleurs / les meilleures.,vocabulary
In addition to le pire / la pire / les pires... what is another way to express 'the worst'?,le PLUS mauvais / la PLUS mauvaise / les PLUS mauvais(es) can be used when 'the worst' references a noun. e.g. La maison est la pire (fem sing). = La maison est la PLUS mauvaise (fem sing).,vocabulary

conjugate 'to be',être: je suis + tu es ('ay') + il/elle/on est ('ay') + nous sommes + vous êtes ('vooz-eht')+ ils/elles sont ('ssson'),verbs
When is est (conjugated 'to be') pronounced as 'ayt' instead of 'ay'?,when the adjective following it starts with a vowel; e.g. Ils est intelligente; If the t in est was not pronounced is would be two vowels together and that is not how french is spoken; But otherwise the t at the end of est is never pronounced.,verbs
When is et (and) pronounced as 'ayt' instead of 'ay'?,Never. Never make the t sound - even when the next word starts with a vowel; e.g. Elle est grande et intelligente - the pronounciation of et does not change.,verbs

What is the difference between FAIRE and SE FAIRE?,FAIRE = to do / to make. SE FAIRE = to get done. SE FAIRE + VERB = to make (someone) do something.; Making the verb reflexive (in this case) is a way to emphasize the verb or to describe pain (e.g. Mes genoux me font mal. = My knees are hurting me.).,verbs

What is the radical of a verb?,The radical is the base of a verb - it generally does not change as the verb is conjugated within the same tense. But the radical may change from one tense to another (e.g. past vs future); NB: For group 1 (-er) and group 2 (-ir) verbs the 'radical du présent' is the part of the infinitive minus ER and IR.; Conjugation for group 3 verbs is more complicated. e.g. The 'radical du futur' for ALLER is IR (nous irons).,verbs
How do you conjugate group 1 verbs (regular -ER verbs) in present tense?,endings: je -e (only pronouce the radical) + tu -es (silent) + il/elle/on -e (silent) + nous -ons (pronounced like nasal 'on') + vous -ez (pronounced like 'ay') + ils/elles -ent (-ent is ALWAYS silent in verbs but it forces the pronunciation of the previous letter),verbs
What is the intonation on the conjugated forms for first person singular (je)?,the intonation is always downward and shortened; e.g. je travaille sounds like 'ju tru-vay' not 'ju trav-a-ye'.,verbs
How do you pronounce the ending for the nous form of -ER verbs?,the ending for nous is -ons ('ohn' very nasal without much of an 'n' sound on the end); this is the same sound as the on in il/elle/on ..when we use the casual form of 'we' when speaking,verbs
What is the only verb ending in -ER that is totally irregular?,aller (to go),verbs
What are some variations or small irregularities that occur when conjugating -ER verbs and which forms to they impact? (disregard the totally irregular verb ALLER),1) In some cases there is an accent change in the second syllable when conjugating -ER verbs au présent (e.g. acheter + préférer); 2) For -YER verbs the Y can stay a Y or it can change to I before adding the endings. Either spelling is 100% correct but the pronunciations are slightly different. If we keep the Y in the spelling then the 'y' sound is heard more in the pronunciation.; When there are irregularities in conjugating -ER verbs au présent all forms are impacted EXCEPT nous and vous forms - those two forms are conjugated exactly as you would expect for -ER verbs.,verbs
How do you conjugate group 2 verbs (regular -ir verbs) in present tense?,endings: je -is ('ee') + tu -is ('ee') + il/elle/on -it ('ee') + nous -issons ('ee-soh'; nasal and pouty) + vous -issez ('ee-say') + ils/elles -issent ('ees' -ent is ALWAYS silent in verbs but it forces the pronunciation of the previous consonant); NB: Sortir is not a regular -IR verb.,verbs
Conjugate the verb for 'to finish'.,finir (regular -ir verb): je finis + tu finis + il/elle/on finit + nous finissons + vous finissez + ils/elles finissent ('fi-nees'; The double S changes the sound of the I and -ent is always silent on verbs.),verbs
Conjugate the verb for 'to choose',choisir (regular -ir verb): je choisis + tu choisis + il/elle/on choisit + nous choisissons ('shwa-Zee-Sohn'; The single S makes a Z sound. The double S makes a Z sound because in between vowels.) + vous choisissez ('shwa-See-Say') + ils/elles choisissent; Alternative: OPTER,verbs
Conjugate the verb for 'to grow up',grandir (regular -ir verb): je grandis + tu grandis + il/elle/on grandit + nous grandissons + vous grandissez + ils/elles grandissent ('gran-dees'; -ent is silent on verbs); NB: Avoid confusion with GROSSIR which means to put on weight.,verbs

How do you pronounce... I want + I go + I see?,Je veux ('voo' but higher in the mouth similar to 'vuh') + Je vais ('vay') + Je vois ('vwa'),pronunciation
Conjugate the verb for 'to go'.,aller: je vais + tu va + il/elle/on va + nous allons + vous allez +ils/elles vont,verbs
Conjugate the verb for 'to come'.,venir: je vien ('vyon') + tu viens ('vyon') + il/elle/on vient ('vyon') + nous venons ('vo-non') + vous venez ('ve-nay') + ils/elles viennent ('vyen'; NB: The double N changes the sound of the vowel that precedes the pair.

Tell (formal) me when it's over.; Specify pronunciation.,Dites-moi ('deeT-mwa') quand c'est fini.; Dites-moi ('deeT-mwa') is formal impératif (vous). If you do not pronounce the T then it sounds like dis-moi which is informal (tu form).,verbs
Tell (informal) me what happened.; Specify pronunciation.,Dis-moi ('dee-mwa') ce qui s'est passé.; Dis-moi ('dee-mwa') is informal impératif (tu). If you want to address the person formally (vous) then you must pronounce the T in dites-moi ('deeT-mwa').,verbs

I said to myself... (a way to express that I was thinking something),J m'ai dit. Use DIRE reflexively: SE DIRE.,verbs

to make someone feel a certain way / to make something change,RENDRE; Meanings include: to render + to produce some effect; RENDRE is also used to mean 'to pay' when we express: to pay a visit to someone + to pay hommage to someone; We do not use FAIRE for these scenarios in french.,verbs

But you must avoid making it a separate syllable. It's not 'shuh-pruh'. It's 'shhhhhpruh'.,verbs
to make a decision,prendre une décision OR rendre une décision; Use prendre - not faire - in most cases. Rendre une décision is more like announcing the decision.,verbs

If I didn't already know Frida...,Si je ne connaissais pas déjà Frida...; Both PAS and DÉJÀ are necessary adverbs.; Use imparfait because you are describing the context (not a discreet action).; NB: When you use CONNAÎTRE to describe knowing a person it means that you actually knew the person (not just knowing 'of them'). To be more clear you should say: Si je ne connaissais pas déjà l'art de Frida...,verbs

The speaker is not using past perfect (had been). Perfect means 'completed' when dealing with verb tenses.; Déja should fall between the two parts of the verb in both cases in french.; Déja is the word to use for a direct translation of 'already' or for when we use the word before to mean already. e.g. I went to the store (before).,vocabulary
I have seen it before. / I have already seen it.,Je l'ai déja vu.; In this case always use passé composé and déja (the adverb) is placed between the auxiliary and past participle.,verbs

It might not work. + It cannot not work.,This is really interesting because the difference in these two meanings occurs only by re-ording the words: Ça peut ne pas marcher. (I might not work. - 50/50 chance) + Ça ne peut pas marcher. (It cannot work. - 100% negative; This is the standard way to negate where NE comes directly after the subject.),vocabulary

How does the pronunciation of the letters 'en' change when we conjugate of comprendre?,je/tu comprends + il comprend etc...the EN is a nasal sound like a mix of 'uhn' and 'ohn' but the N is actually silent.

I expect that you will be happy.,Je m’attends À ce que tu sois heureux/euse.; S'ATTENDRE triggers preposition À which means there must be an object after À (ce que - not just que). S'ATTENDRE also triggers the subjonctif if a phrase follows the preposition (because an expectation is a wish).,verbs
I did not expect the person to do that.,Je ne m'attendais pas À ce que la personne fasse (subjonctif) ça.; S'ATTENDRE triggers preposition À which means there must be an object after À (ce que - not just que). S'ATTENDRE also triggers the subjonctif if a phrase follows the preposition (because a negated expectation is a doubt).,verbs
She expected me to catch up with her.,Elle s'attendait À ce que je la rattrape.; S'ATTENDRE (to expect) triggers preposition À which means there must be an object after À (ce que - not just que).; RATTRAPER = to catch up. The person (or thing) that you catch up to is the direct object of rattraper. So use COD (la) instead of COI (lui).,verbs
I expect you to catch up with me.,Je m'attends À ce que tu me rattrape.; S'ATTENDRE (to expect) triggers preposition À which means there must be an object after À (ce que - not just que).; RATTRAPER = to catch up.

to last/to extend,durer; dur(e) is the adjective for 'hard' meaning difficult; durer la nuit = to make the nightime last longer,verbs

Elle S'approche DE la fenêtre. = She approaches (reflexive) the window.; 2) RAPPROCHER qqch DE qqch: This is an emphasized version of approcher that can mean to re-join. Elle rapproche la table DE la fenêtre. = She moves the table even closer to the window. L'orage se rapproche. = The thunder is getting even closer.,verbs
We approached eachother.,Nous nous sommes approchés.; S'APPROCHER is the best verb choice. SE RAPPROCHER would mean to get closer than before.,verbs
She approached me. + She approached me again.,Elle m'a approché. + Elle m'a REapproché.; APPROCHER is the correct verb for when someone comes up to you. But if you say Elle m'a approché encore... the connotation is very negative (an unwanted approach a second time). So use REAPPROCHER to explain that someone came up to you again without a negative connotation.,verbs
We became closer (emotionally) over time.,Nous nous sommes rapprochés.; SE RAPPROCHER is the best verb choice. S'APPROCHER would mean to approach eachother.,verbs

a hope + a wish + a want,un espoir + un souhait + un voeux; NB: un voeux is stronger and more specific than un souhait,vocabulary
to wish + to make a wish,souhaiter + faire un voeux; We say 'faire un voeux' (instead of 'faire un souhait') because un voeux is a very specific want/wish - it is the kind of thing you ask for when blowing out candles or talking to a genie.,verbs
to create + to conceive of (something),créer + concevoir; CRÉER is a regular -ER verb (e.g. je crée + tu crées). CONCEVOIR is irregular: je conçois + tu conçois + il conçoit + nous concevons + vous concevez + ils conçoivent,verbs

to fart,péter,verbs
to drink,boire: je bois ('bwa') + tu bois + il/elle/on boit + nous buvons + vous buvez + ils/elles boivent ('bwav'); past participle: bu,verbs

Do not use voyager for this in everyday speech. e.g. Je vais à Londres = I go to London.; Casually you might say J'ai fait (or je vais faire) Paris. = I 'did' (or 'will do') Paris. You can use the verb faire casually in this way the same way we use it in English.,verbs

I visited the monument. + I visited my friend.,J'ai visité le monument (no preposition / COD). + J'ai rendu visite À mon ami (requires preposition + COI; visite = COD; mon ami = COI); VISITER qqch vs RENDRE VISITE À qqn; Rendu is the past participle for RENDRE but generally RENDRE is conjugated similar to PRENDRE.,verbs
My friend visited me. + My friend came to Paris to visit me.,Mon ami(e) M'a rendu visite. + Mon ami(e) est venu(e) à Paris POUR ME rendre visite.; 'à moi' turns into the pronoun 'me' and is moved in front of the verb.,verbs

What is the difference between these verbs: assembler + rassembler + sembler + ressembler,assembler: to physically assemble + rassembler: to gather together + sembler: to seem like in a figurative way + ressembler à: to be physically or concretely similar; It is common in french to add R- or RE- prefix to a verb to emphasize it or adjust the meaning. This does not necessarily mean that the verb is performed again.,verbs
She looks like Jane.,Elle ressemble À Jane.; Use RESSEMBLER À to express that two things (people + cities + etc) physically look similar or are concretely similar in some way. Use SEMBLER DE or AVOIR L'AIR DE when using an adjective or to make a comparison to a noun or verb in a figurative way.; Alternative: passer pour qqn = to pass as someone (to look extremely similar to someone),verbs
She looked relieved.,Elle avait l'air soulagée.; Use AVOIR L'AIRE + ADJECTIVE.,verbs
What does she look like?,À quoi elle ressemble?; Literally: 'Of what' she resembles? Use À QUOI becuase the 'what' is an object (not the subject) and the verb (RESSEMBLER) requires the preposition À when you are specifying concrete physical characteristics. (We cannot use SEMBLER + avoir l'air + etc. when specifying concrete physical characteristics.),verbs
It seems cute.,Il/Elle a l'air mignon(ne). OR Il/Elle semble mignon(ne).; When using an adjective (cute) you do not need a preposition after the verb. AVOIR L'AIR X or SEMBLER X.; We cannot use RESSEMBLER because that means concrete physical similarity instead of figurative similarity.,verbs
Your eyes look tired.,Tes yeux ont l'air fatigués.; Use AVOIR L'AIRE + ADJECTIVE.,vocabulary
I find her to be kind.,Je la trouve sympa.; This is one way to express that something seems like something else (figuratively - not concretely in a physical way). It avoids the verbs sembler and avoir l'air.,verbs
They seemed nice.,Ils avaient l'air gentil(le)s.; When using an adjective (nice) you do not need a preposition after the verbs AVOIR L'AIR or SEMBLER.; Use imparfait because you are describing the context in a story - as opposed to actions that are sequential.,verbs
She looks/sounds/seems sad.,Elle a l'air triste.; Use AVOIR L'AIRE + ADJECTIVE or SEMBLER + ADJECTIVE in this case. No preposition is required after the verb when using an adjective.,verbs
It looks/sounds/seems funny (or weird).,Il a l'air bête/marrant. = It sounds funny/silly/odd.; Bête means stupid but it is used in a light-hearted way here.; Use AVOIR L'AIRE + ADJECTIVE or SEMBLER + ADJECTIVE in this case. No preposition is required after the verb when using an adjective.,verbs
I find it funny (or weird).,Je le ('zszszszluh') trouve amusante.; When phrased in this way (instead of using avoir l'air or sembler) you can use amusant(e) which loosely means fun or funny.; When JE is followed by an L it does not sound like 'shhhh'. Instead it sounds closer to an English J 'zszszszs'. But it is still a long slow sound without forming a separate syllable.,verbs
idiomatic way to express: It's a funny thing.,C'est marrant ce truc!,vocabulary
It looks like a turtle. + It seems like a turtle.,Ça ressemble À une tortue. + Ça semble D'une tortue.; Use RESSEMBLER for concrete similarities (especially physical characteristics). Use SEMBLER DE or AVOIR L'AIR DE to make a comparison to a noun or verb in a figurative way.,verbs
It seems cosmopolitan. + It seems like Paris.,Ça a l'air cosmopolite. + Ça a l'air DE Paris.; In the first sentence we use an adjective (cosmopolite) so no preposition is required. In the second sentence we must use SEMBLER DE or AVOIR L'AIR DE to make a comparison to a noun or verb in a figurative way.,verbs
What does he seem like?,DE quoi il a l'air?; Use AVOIR L'AIR DE (or SEMBLER DE) to make a comparison to a noun or verb in a figurative way.,verbs
It didn't seem like a hotel.,Il n'avait pas l'air D'un hôtel.; Use AVOIR L'AIR DE (or SEMBLER DE) to make a comparison to a noun or verb in a figurative way.; Use imparfait to describe context in the past.,verbs
It didn't seem like anything.,Ça avait l'air DE rien.; Use AVOIR L'AIR DE (or SEMBLER DE) to make a comparison to a noun or verb in a figurative way.; Use imparfait to describe context in the past.,verbs
She is like my teachers in NY.,Elle est COMME mes professeurs à NY.; COMME is alternative way to make figurative comparisons (instead of SEMBLER and AVOIR L'AIR).,verbs
Her behavior is like (that of) my teachers in NY.,Son comportement ressemble À CEUX de mes professeurs à NY.; In french you have to specify what is similar in both the subject and the object.; Use RESSEMBLER (instead of SEMBLER or AVOIR L'AIR) we are making a concrete objective comparison.,verbs
As if I was talking to myself..., COMME SI je parlais tout seul...; comme si... = as if...,vocabulary
As a... / Speaking as a...,en tant que; This is a common french expression that is used for times when you want to describe a person fully embodying a role. e.g. He is working as an X.; This is not the correct phrase when you are comparing people/things. e.g. He eats like a bird.,vocabulary
She is working as an engineer. + She works on a book.,Elle travaille EN TANT QUE ingénieur. + Elle travaille un livre.; NB: There is no preposition (de + sur + etc) after the verb travailler when you want to describe working 'on' something.,vocabulary
I am qualified to work as a delivery person.,Je suis prêt(e) à travailler en tant qu'un livreur / une livreuse.,vocabulary
He moves like a danser.,Il bouge COMME un danseur.; COMME is the correct word to use for this comparison - instead of EN TANT QUE or AUSSI - because you are not really saying that he is a danser and the quality is not quantified.,vocabulary
X is similar to Y,X est similair à Y.; Use À after the adjective.,vocabulary
a similarity,une similitude (not 'ay') OR une ressemblance,vocabulary
They were not happy as a couple.,Ils n'étaient pas heureux en tant que couple.,vocabulary
The sound that is pleasant.,Le son qui fait plaisir.; FAIRE PLAISIR is how you describe something that is pleasant. Literally: makes pleasure,verbs
The word is native american.,Le mot est originaire d'amérique.; In this case avoir l'air is not the best choice - in part because there is not a great verb in french that means 'native american'. un natif américain = is a person (not an adjective),vocabulary
Like father like son.,Tel père tel fils.; TEL  is a qualifying adjective used to express similarity - similar to 'like' in English.,vocabulary
We reduce the cost of living as well as the salary earned.,On réduit les coûts de vivre MÊME QUE les salaires qu'on gagne.; même que can be used like comme to make a comparison between two complete phrases.,vocabulary

to live at (e.g. in a city or in some apartment/home); Specify pronunciation conjugated au présent.,HABITER; The H is silent so you must treat this verb as if it starts with a vowel. That means you must make liaison with subject pronouns: j'habite ('zshah-beet') + tu habites ('too-ah-beet') + il habite ('ee-Lah-beet') + nous habitons ('noo-Zah-bee-ton') + vous habitez ('voo-Zah-bee-tay') + ils habitent ('eel-Zah-beet'),verbs

a record (of something happening),une preuve (literally: a proof) is the best translation,vocabulary
to prove,prouver; alternative: éprouver means to try or test the quality of something. This can mean 'to experience' as well.,verbs
What does this mean: J'ai de l'adresse.,I am very efficient.; In this case the noun l'adresse does not mean a physical location. It means high efficiency and dexterity. It is the opposite of clumsiness.,vocabulary

to gain weight,grossir; prendre du poids = another common say to express gaining weight in an unplanned way; prendre du muscle = putting on weight/muscle on purpose; NB: GROSSIR: to grow bigger/fatter laterally. GRANDIR: to grow in height / to 'grow up' (become an adult),verbs
to lose weight,maigrir; alternative: mincir = to get thinner,verbs

When I grew up... (in the past),Quand j'ai grandi...; Use GRANDIR when we are talking about a person growing in height.,verbs
When I grow up... (in the future),Quand je grandirai... OR Quand je serai grand(e)...; We must use futur simple (instead of futur proche etc) in this case because the word 'quand' triggers futur simple.,verbs
The tree grows.,L'arbre pousse.; Use POUSSER to describe growth of something that is not a person. GRANDIR is used exclusively for people.,verbs
I grow a plant. + I grow (out) my hair.,Je fais pousser une plante. + Je fais pousser mes cheveux.; In both of these cases the thing that is growing (plant + hair) is not the subject of the sentence so we cannot use POUSSER/GRANDIR. Instead we use FAIRE + POUSSER to describe a person growing some inanimate object. e.g. faire pousser des légumes = to grow vegetables,verbs

to copy + to imitate,copier (literal translation) + recopier (when you copy someone's movements) + imiter (to imitate); IMITER borders on making fun of something. For example the word for mimic (un imitateur) is only used for someone who is imitating as part of a performance to make fun of someone.,verbs
to begin,commencer; DÉMARRER can be used as an alternative.; NB: faire démarrer = to turn on something with a motor or engine (like a washing machine).,verbs
to stop,arrêter; If the object is not explicit then you must use the reflexive form: S'ARRÊTER. e.g. J'arrête (non-reflexive) la machine à laver. Je me suis arrêté (reflexive).; ARRÊTER also means 'to arrest' when police take custody of someone.,verbs
to arrest someone (when the police take custody of someone),arrêter; This is the same word that means 'to stop'. So if you mean that a policeman simply stopped you from crossing a barrier (instead of arresting you) then use a different verb (e.g. BLOQUER).,verbs
to restart + to continue,recommencer + continuer,verbs
to begin a career + to begin to dance,commencer une carrière (no preposition) + commencer À danser; COMMENCER and CONTINUER trigger À before a verb. But no preposition is required when the object is a noun.,verbs
to continue a career + to continue to dance,continuer une carrière (no preposition) + continuer À danser; COMMENCER and CONTINUER trigger À before a verb. But no preposition is required when the object is a noun.,verbs
We started over from the beginning.,On l'a recommencé du début.,verbs

to turn down (the radio + the volume),baisser ('bay-Say') la radio; Pay attention to the pronunciation of baisser ('bay-Say'). If you use a Z sound instead then it means to fuck (baiser).,verbs
to raise the tone + to lower the tone (e.g. of a discussion),monter d'un ton + baisser ('bay-Say') d'un ton; These phrases have two meanings in french: 1) to describe the increase/decrease of tension (or negative tone) in a conversation 2) If you tell someone 'baisser d'un ton' you are telling them to 'calm down' or 'quiet down' (when the music is too loud). Never say this directly. It is extremely condescending and inflammatory. But you can use 'baisser d'un ton' (nicely and apologetically) when you are asking someone to turn down the music when it is too loud and the walls are thin.,verbs
to log in + to register (for an online account),se connecter + s'incrire; ENREGISTRER can be used to mean 'to register' but it is more often used to mean 'also means 'to record'.,verbs

to follow (a person + a diet + a course of study); Conjugate the verb.,suivre; Watch out because it is conjugated the same as être in some cases: je suis + tu suis + il suit + nous suivons + vous suivez + ils suivent; Alternative: succéder can mean to follow or to continue afterwards.,verbs

to disappear,disparaître; This is the opposite of apparaître (to appear literally and physically from nothing),verbs

If you use that phrase` you will appear arrogant.,Si vous utilisez cette expression` vous paraîtrez arrogant.; PARAÎTRE is teh verb that means to figuratively appear.,verbs
to contain,contenir; This verb has an irregular conjugation: je contiens + tu contiens + il/elle/on contient + nous contenons + vous contenez + ils/elles contiennent; tenir = to hold,verbs

an improvement,une amélioration,vocabulary
in order to improve my french + in order to improve my technical skills,pour améliorer mon français + pour améliorer mes compétences techniques,verbs
in order to improve my hearing (of french) + in order to improve my speaking (of french),pour améliorer mon écoute (ma compréhension orale) + pour améliorer mon orale; Une orale is feminine. So the correct possessive pronoun is MA but it changes to MON if it is directly followed by a vowel.,verbs
I try to improve.,J'essaie DE m'améliorer (reflexive infinitive); Use the reflexive form of the verb because you are improving yourself / your own skills.,verbs
I have to prove my skills.,Je dois faire mes preuves.; Do not use the verb prouver in this context. Use instead: faire les preuves.,verbs
to master (a subject),maîtriser,verbs

to heal / treat,se soigner is the verb typically used for 'to heal' or 'to be treated'; NB: TRAITER is the literal translation but it does not necessarily connote healing/health. It means to 'treat' someone as something and often this is meant in a lightly derogatory way.,verbs
to abuse / mistreat,maltraiter; This has TRAITER (to treat) as the base but TRAITER does not mean 'to heal'. TRAITER is closer to 'treat someone as'.,verbs
idiomatic way to express: She thinks that I'm a pig (messy).,Elle me traite de porc.; SE TRAITER is often used in a lightly derogatory way to express thinking of someone as something. It loosely connects to the verb 'to treat' in English.,conversation
to cure + a cure,guérir + une cure,verbs

to predict + to foresee,prédire + prévoir,verbs
predictable + unpredictable,prévisible + imprévisible,vocabulary

to run over with a car,renverser; This is probably the best word for this case. Use bousculer if you mean to bump into.,verbs
an upheaval (a major change),un bouleversement; This comes from the verb BOULEVERSER which means to catastrophically upset / up-end.,vocabulary
to turn upside-down,reNverser (do not forget the N) or chambouler; RENVERSER (to turn upside down or completely topple) and REVERSER (to re-pour; without N) are faux amis. If you mean 'to reverse / go backward' then use RECULER (as in 'recoil').,verbs

to make the most of / to take advantage of,profiter DE; This verb always uses DE before the object.; e.g. take advantage of opportunities = des opportunités EN profiter. Use EN because we are replacing DE + something.; This verb has a positive connotation on its own. The assumption is that the benefit to the subject is benevelent. PROFITE DE only has a negative meaning if you specify that you are doing the action for a negative outcome.,verbs
I enjoy the voyage. + I take advantage of the voyage to learn something. + I take the opportunity to learn something new.,J'aime bien le voyage. + Je PROFITE DE la voyage POUR apprendre quelques chose. + J'EN PROFITE POUR apprendre quelques chose.; In the last sentence the thing that you are taking advantage of is understood (pronom EN).; NB: This is a contrived example. In french it is extremely rare (sounds strange) to use the present tense for both phrases. Normally these kinds of phrases are used in the past of the future tenses.,verbs
I will enjoy it.,J'y prendrai plaisir. PRENDRE DU PLAISIR + À is the best choice for expressing 'to enjoy' when the motive is not explicit. Use pronom Y because prendre du plaisir + À + the thing or action you enjoy.; Alternative: J'en profiterai. Use EN because PROFITER uses DE instead of À.,verbs

This is an appropriate use of PROFITER + POUR. Either everything happens in the past or everything happens in the future. Also it is appropriate to use présent + futur. But it sounds strange to use présent + présent.,verbs
I will read this book. I will take advantage of it to learn the history of France.,Je vais lire ce livre. Je vais EN profiter pour apprendre l'histoire de la France.; Both phrases are in a future tense. This is an appropriate use of PROFITER + POUR. Either everything happens in the past or everything happens in the future. Also it is appropriate to use présent + futur. But it sounds strange to use présent + présent.,verbs

to reach,atteindre; Watch out because this must sound different form éteindre (to turn off).,verbs
to bias (something) / to skew (something),biaiser,verbs
biased,partial(e) OR pas impartial(e) OR biaisé(e); Alternative: avoir un préjugé contre = to be biased against; This is a faux ami. un préjuge = a bias BUT un préjudice = an injury/harm.,vocabulary
to favor,favoriser,verbs
ethical,éthique; alternative: moral(e); ethics = l'éthique,vocabulary

to miss (emotionally) something,This cannot be translated directly because the subject and object are often inverted (comparing French and English) to express lacking/missing.; MANQUER + À + indirect object = to be missed (emotionally) by someone/something (the indirect object),verbs
to be missed (emotionally) by someone/something,MANQUER + À + indirect object; The subject and object are inverted (comparing French and English). e.g. My mother misses my brother. becomes... My brother is missed by my mother... = Mon frère manque À ma mère.,verbs
The dog misses (emotionally) the cat.,Le chat manque au (À + le) chien.; The subject/object are inverted (comparing English and French). So the phrase must be transformed to: The cat is missed by (MANQUER + À) the dog.,verbs

I miss X Y and Z.,X Y et Z... Ils me manque.; The subject/object are inverted (comparing English and French). So the phrase must be transformed: X Y and Z are missed by (MANQUER + À) me.

Do you miss home?,Est-ce que ta maison te manque?; The subject/object are inverted (comparing English and French). So the phrase must be transformed: Is your home missed by (MANQUER + À) you?

But there are better verbs to use for that case. e.g. CROISSER or REVOIR,verbs
I met (for the first time) my friend.,J'ai rencontré mon ami(e).; Use (se) rencontrer (instead of se voir or se retrouver) because you are meeting for the first time or by chance.; You do not need to use the verb reflexively in this case because the object is explicit. So use avoir as the auxiliary and the standard participe passé.,verbs
I met them (for the first time).,Je les ai rencontré.; In french 'them' is a direct object of rencontrer so we use LES to represent the plural people.; Use (se) rencontrer because you are meeting for the first time or by chance.; You do not need to use the verb reflexively in this case because the object is explicit.,verbs
We met (for the first time) in Berlin.,On s'est rencontrés à Berlin.; Use (se) rencontrer because you are meeting for the first time or by chance.; Use the verb reflexively because the object is not explicit (subject and object are the same).

Did you meet them all in France?,Est-ce que tu les as tous rencontrés en France?; Use rencontrer (instead of retrouver) because you are meeting for the first time.; You do not need to use the reflexive form because both subject (tu) and object (les) are explicit - there is no implied 'eachother'.,verbs
idiomatic way to express: the new people that you meet (e.g. after moving to a new city),des nouvelles rencontres,vocabulary

We met up (friends that already knew eachother).,Nous nous sommes vu(e)s.; Use (SE) VOIR when meeting up with someone you already know in a planned way.; In this case the object is not explicit (the subject and object are the same).

We will meet again.,Nous nous verrons encore.; Use (SE) VOIR when meeting up with someone you already know in a planned way.; In this case the object is not explicit (the subject and object are the same). So we use the verb reflexively.,verbs
Pay attention to pronunciation: She will meet Marc (for the first time).,futur simple: Elle rencontrera Marc. ('rohn-kohn-truh-ra'); All of the syllables are pronounced - you cannot drop any of them.; The first syllable is a classic french E - something between 'rohn' and 'ruhn'.,verbs
Pay attention to pronunciation: She will tell a story.,futur simple: Elle racontera ('ra-kohn-tra') une histoire.; The first syllable should clearly sound like a french A (not a french E) like the English word 'racoon'. The penultimate syllable gets dropped (like medecin). This would not happen if there was an R directly after the T in the infinitive form.; The infinitive is raconter ('ra-kohn-tay'). The T is much clearer in the inifinitive.,verbs

It does not require a reflexive pronoun AND it does not require any preposition between the verb and the object. When you use the reflexive pronoun it means to reflect back on.,verbs
How do you say: I remember him. Two ways: 1) with SOUVENIR 2) with RAPPELER,1) Je me souviens de lui. Always reflexive. Always require DE between verb and object. 2) Je me le rappelle. Literally: I remind myself of him. But the object is NOT a pronom tonique because the thing being recalled is a direct object of (SE) RAPPELER - without preposition DE.,verbs
I remember it.,Je m'EN souviens. (juh-muh-soo-vyuh); SE SOUVENIR (to remember) is the verb and it is reflexive (me/m'); Pronom EN replaces 'it' because SE SOUVENIR is followed by DE. Do NOT use regular pronouns for the 'it'. e.g. Do NOT say: Je me le souviens.;  Pronom EN replaces a quantity of something or the complement of a verb following DE.,verbs
I remember the times before everyone had Google Maps.,Je me souviens de l’époque (or DU TEMPS) où tout le monde avait Google Maps.; Alternative: Je me souviens de l’époque / du temps avant que tout le monde ait (subjonctif) Google Maps. AVANT QUE triggers subjonctif but après que does not.,verbs

I remember a little bit.,Je m'EN souviens un peu. OR Je me souviens un peu DE ça.,verbs
I don't remember the conjugation.,Je ne me souviens pas DE la conjugaison.; SE SOUVENIR (conjugated) + DE + the thing that was forgotten,verbs
I don't remember everything.,Je ne me souviens pas DE tout.; SE SOUVENIR (conjugated) + DE + the thing that was forgotten,verbs

I would like to remember it.,Je voudrais m'EN souvenir.; Vouloir does not require a preposition before the 2nd verb. Use EN to refer to the thing that you are remembering. The reflexive pronoun (ME) must adapt to the subject even though we are using the infinitive form (souvenir).,verbs
She remembers that I had a good day.,Elle se souvient (or se rappelle) QUE j'ai passé une bonne journée.; SE SOUVENIR can use que (instead of de) when what follows is a complete phrase.; When using the verb PASSER (to mean spending time) you must use the duration periods (e.g. une soirée instead of un soir).,verbs

What is the general rule for how a verb radical changes moving from past tenses to future tenses (regardless of verb mood)?,Generally the past tenses use a shortened radical (sans R). e.g. parl for parler + av for avoir + dev for devoir + all for aller. This holds for indicatif imparfait and indicatif présent.; Generally the futur tenses use a longer radical (often including an R). e.g. parler for parler + aur for avoir + devr for devoir + ir for aller. This holds for conditionnel présent and indicatif futur simple / futur antérieur.; This means that when you hear a lot of R sounds then someone is generally speaking in a future tense (regardless of the verb mood).,verbs
What is the 'présent progressif' verb tense?,Progressif means ongoing. So présent progressif emphasizes something that is happening / ongoing (literally) right now.; In English we use présent participe for progressive tenses (I am eating.).

the learning,l'apprendisage (masculine); e.g. learning french = l'apprendisage du langue français,vocabulary
I am dressing/getting dressed.,Je suis en train de ME habiller.; When using présent progressif tense with a reflexive verb... the reflexive pronoun stays with the infinitive. But it must adapt to the subject (e.g. me instead of se).,verbs
He was jumping/leaping.,Il était en train de sauter.; Jumping is an english présent participe (an ongoing activity) which means that we need to use a progressive tense in french (être + en train de + infinitive). But this is happening in the past so we conjugate être in imparfait (was doing something): était.; This is an alternative (to imparfait) for expressing context in the past.,verbs
She will be jumping/leaping.,Elle sera en train de sauter.; Jumping is an english présent participe (an ongoing activity) which means that we need to use a progressive tense in french (être + en train de + infinitive). But this is happening in the future (not present) so we conjugate être in futur simple (will be doing something): sera.,verbs
What is the 'passé recent' verb tense?,This verb tense expresses that something was 'just happening' before the current state or before some other action. e.g. I just read that book. = Je viens de lire ce livre.; NB: This structure aligns with how we generally connect two verbs: conjugated verb + DE + infinitive verb.,verbs
How do you construct the 'passé recent' verb tense?,VENIR conjugated + DE + INFINITIVE; You must adapt reflexive pronouns to the subject.; You can add 'juste' for emphasis after the conjugated form of VENIR but it is not a requirement.,verbs
I just arrived.,Je viens (juste) D'arriver.; Use passé recent: VENIR conjugated + DE + INFINITIVE; You can optionally add 'juste' for emphasis.,verbs

They just found a new apartment.,Ils viennent (juste) DE trouver un nouvel appartement (OR un appart which is short for appartement).; Use passé recent: VENIR conjugated + DE + INFINITIVE; NB: The adjective nouveau (masc sing) changes to nouvel when the noun starts with a vowel. This avoids two vowels against eachother. This behavior only happens to some adjectives that are placed before a noun.,verbs
She had just eaten.,Elle venait (juste) de manger.; Use passé recent (VENIR conjugated + DE + INFINITIVE) but conjugate venir in impafait (instead of present) to indicate that everything happened in the past.,verbs
He moves to Brazil in 1929.,Il déménage au Brésil en 1929.; You can use present tense to describe something in the past - just like in english.,verbs

I leave tonight.,Je pars (présent) ce soir (futur).; You can use present tense to describe something in the future - just like in english.,verbs
What is the 'impératif' verb mood?,Impératif mood expresses a command - something that you want someone to do.; It has two verb tenses: impératif présent (Do something right now.) and impératif passé (Have something done by midnight.),verbs
How do you construct the 'impératif présent' for group 1 (-ER) verbs?,There are only 3 possibilities: tu + nous + vous. Omit the subject because it is assumed. Then use the indicatif présent conjugation of the verb. For regular -ER verbs: remove the S from the tu form.; e.g. Eat the food.: (tu) Mange / (nous) Mangeons / (vous) Mangez la nourriture.,verbs
(you informal) Cut the bread.,Coupe le pain.; COUPER is a regular -er verb so we use the present tense conjugation for tu (coupes) and then remove the S.,verbs
(we / let's) Change the sheets.,Changeons les draps.; CHANGER is the verb. The present tense conjugation for nous is changeons.,verbs
(you formal) Listen.,écoutez.; ÉCOUTER is the verb. The present tense conjugation for vous is écoutez.,verbs
How do you construct the 'impératif présent' for group 2 (-IR) verbs?,Keep the final S in the tu form.; e.g. Finish the food.: (tu) Finis / (nous) Finissons / (vous) Finissez la nourriture.; NB: Sortir is not a regular -IR verb.,verbs
(you informal / let's / you formal) Go to the store.,(tu) Va / (nous) Allons / (vous) Allez au magasin.; Aller is treated as a regular -ER verb in this case so we remove the S from the conjugated tu form.,verbs
(you informal / let's / you formal) Cook the meat.,(tu) Fais cuire / (nous) Faisons / (vous) Faites le viande.; Faire is an irregular verb so we do not delete the S at the end of the tu verb form!,verbs
(you informal / let's / you formal) Be nice.,(tu) Sois / (nous) Soyons / (vous) Soyez sympa.; être is a fully irregular verb in the impératif mood so you have to memorize all three conjugations.,verbs
(you informal / let's / you formal) Get a cat.,Use the verb avoir (to have): (tu) Aie / (nous) Ayons / (vous) Ayez un chat.; avoir is a completely irregular verb in the impératif mood so you have to memorize all three conjugations.,verbs
(you informal / let's / you formal) Put on the coat.,Use the verb mettre (to put): (tu) Mets / (nous) Mettons / (vous) Mettez le manteau.; Keep the S on the tu form because mettre is irregular in the impératif mood.,verbs
(you informal / let's / you formal) Do something.,Use the verb faire: (tu) Fais / (nous) Faisons / (vous) Faites quelque chose.; Keep the S on the tu form because faire is irregular in the impératif mood.,verbs
How do you construct the 'impératif présent' for reflexive verbs?,The pronoun gets attached to the end of the verb.; e.g. (you informal) Go for a walk! = Promène-toi!; SE PROMENER is an -er verb so the S is omitted in the you informal form.,verbs
Let's go for a walk!,(nous) Promenons-nous!; Use the impératif command form. SE PROMENER is the verb. To make the impératif for a reflexive verb attach the pronoun after the verb.,verbs
(you informal) Hurry up!,Dépêche-toi!; SE DÉPÊCHER = to hurry up (oneself). It is generally used reflexively.,verbs
(you formal) Register! / Sign up!,(vous) Inscrivez-vous!; Use the impératif command form. S'INSCRIRE is the verb. To make the impératif for a reflexive verb attach the pronoun after the verb.; the registration = l'inscription (from S'INSCRIRE),verbs
(you formal) Do not eat that!,(vous) Ne mangez pas ça!; Use the impératif command form. Mangez ça! would be the positive command. To negate it: NE is placed directly after where the (omitted) subject would be. PAS is placed directly following the verb.,verbs
(formal / informal) Drink lots of water.,Bois / Buvez plus de l'eau.; NB: When plus is followed by DE then the S is pronounced 'plooews'.,verbs
(formal / informal) Always sleep for 8 hours.,Dors / Dormez depuis huit heures pour toutes les nuits.,verbs

How do you construct the 'futur proche' verb tense?,ALLER conjugated + INFINITIVE of the action verb; The direct translation is 'X is going to do something'. NB: All object pronouns are placed between the two verbs!,verbs
When do you use the futur proche tense in writing?,The usage is different when speaking and when writing!; When writing: Use futur proche for 1) something that will happen imminently - not years from now 2) something that will happen as a natural consequence of some action e.g. warning a child... Tu vas tomber! 3) an action that is lightly planned - not a major commitment/project/vision - that may or may not change in the future (lower certainty than futur simple) 4) a change to the status quo; If something is more intentionally planned (like a project/goal) or will occur further into the future or has higher certainty (with the exception of projections)... then use futur simple (instead of futur proche) in writing.,verbs
When do you use the future proche tense in speaking?,The usage is different when speaking and when writing!; When speaking: It is very common for people to use futur proche for anything in the future because it's easy to formulate and it's very dynamic (it indicates action that is lightly planned - not a manifesto on what you will undertake over the next year or 5 years).; It is especially correct to use futur proche to discuss the weather or to say something like: Le année prochaine je vais aller... because you made the time frame clear.,verbs
They are going to eat. Use futur proche.,Ils vont manger.,verbs
After we go to the cinema we will drink some wine. Use futur proche.,après on va au cinema on va boire DU vin.; Remember that BOIRE is always followed by DE. de + le = du,verbs
You are going to eat it (masculine). Use futur proche.,Tu va le manger.; Note how the object pronoun is placed in between the two verbs in futur proche.,verbs
I am going to help you. Use futur proche.,Je vais t'aider.; Note how the object pronoun is placed in between the two verbs in futur proche.; The pronoun te ends in a vowel and the infinitive starts with a vowel so we condense them using apostrophe.,verbs
How do you construct the 'indicatif futur simple' verb tense?,ENTIRE INFINITIVE* + ending that agrees with subject (je –AI + tu -AS + il/elle/on -A + nous -ONS + vous -EZ + ils/elles -ONT); *except for 3rd group and irregular verbs which typically transform into something that ends in an R; NB: The endings for the nous form and ils form sound exactly the same and they are NOT silent! (not like -ENT au présent).; NB: Most of the endings are the same as AVOIR conjugated au présent.,verbs
What are the two non-intuitive things regarding pronunciation in indicatif futur simple?,1) ils/elles -ONT ending in futur simple is pronounced (not silent like -ENT au présent) 2) We often drop a syllable in futur simple. e.g. PRÉSENTER: il présentera ('pray-suhn-TRA'). Drop the penultimate syllable like médicin. This often results in a heavy R sound at the end of the verb - the characteristic sound of futur simple.; NB: There are times when the R is skipped. e.g. Ils diffuseront ('di-fuh-sont').,verbs
What is the radical used for indicatif futur simple for -ER verbs (group 1) and -IR verbs (group 2)?,the entire infinitive for both group 1 and group 2 verbs; e.g. parler and choisir; NB: This is the same base used for conditionnel présent.; NB: There are some verbs that end in -IR but that are not regular. e.g. sortir + partir + venir + tenir,verbs
What is the radical used for indicatif futur simple for group 3 verbs ending in -RE (e.g. prendre + dire + croire + descendre)?,Simply drop the final E. So the R remains lending to the heavy R sound of futur simple.; prendre:prendr + dire:dir + croire:croir + descendre:descendr; NB: This is the same base used for the conditionnel présent.,verbs
What are the radicals used for indicatif futur simple for these irregular verbs: être + aller + faire + venir + pouvoir + devoir?,Even the irregular verbs use a radical that ends in R - contributing to the heavy R sound of futur simple.;être:ser + aller:ir + faire:fer + venir:viendr + pouvoir:pourr + devoir:devr; Make sure that you are pronouncing SER and FER bases like a classic french E (rounded mouth; mix between 'uh' and 'oh').; NB: These are the same bases used for the conditionnel présent.,verbs
What is the difference between these two: serai + serrai?,It's really important to pronounce these differently. 1) serai ('suh-ray') is the verb être in futur simple. The E in future forms of être (base: ser) sound like the classic french E (a mix of 'uh' and 'oh' because the mouth is rounded). 2) serrais ('say-ray') is the verb serrer (to tighten) in imparfait. The RR changes the sound of the E.; If you pronounce the future forms of être (like serai) with an 'ay' sound then it sounds like a different verb. ,pronunciation
What are the future bases for these irregular verbs: avoir + savoir + voir?,avoir:aur + savoir:saur (savoir is conjugated the same as avoir but with an S at the beginning) + voir:verr (voir is totally different than avoir and savoir); NB: These are the same bases used for the conditionnel tense.,verbs
What are the future bases for these irregular verbs: pouvoir + vouloir + devoir + falloir?,pouvoir:pourr + vouloir:voudr + devoir:devr + falloir:faudr; NB: These are the same bases used for the conditionnel présent.,verbs
What are the future bases for these irregular verbs: venir + tenir?,venir: viendr + tenir: tiendr,verbs
When should you use futur simple? (instead of futur proche),The general rule (with some exceptions) is to use futur simple for higher certainty (highly planned) events. Use futur proche for lower stakes events that have slightly less certainty or for natural consequences of some action. Use futur simple: 1) To make a promise. Using futur simple indicates higher certainty so it will mean more if you promise in this tense. 2) To describe significant plans for the future (e.g. large projects). Use futur proche (instead) for minor plans like meeting a friend for coffee. 3) To discuss something that is not imminent - happening in the coming months and years. 4) To express a projection (e.g. how some metric will grow or what the weather will be like). This is an exception to the general rule because projections are not high certainty. 5) To discuss the result/consequence of a change OR an ongoing change. 6) For politeness or formality when making a request. e.g. Vous appellerez Madame Dupont?,verbs
When should you never use futur simple?,Never use futur simple directly following SI (if) but you can use futur simple for the consquence. e.g. Si on mange trop (use présant because 'if' makes this part of the sentence a hypothetical)` alors on grossit (use futur simple because this part of the sentence is the consequence).,verbs
How do you pronounce these? je voudrais (conditionnel présent) + je voudrai (indicatif futur simple),Technically they are pronounced exactly the same: 'juh-voo-dray'. But french people tend to drag out the ending when they mean to use the conditionnel présent: 'juh-voo-draaaay'. When they intend futur simple then they keep the ending short: 'juh-voo-dray'.,pronunciation
What verb tense will generally follow these setups: Quand ... + Pendent que ... + J'espére que ...?,Assuming you are describing an event in the future then use futur simple in these phrases.,verbs
When should you use alors vs puis?,Alors is a good transition word when you are revealing a consequence of the earlier sentence (e.g. if i eat too much then i will gain weight).; Puis should only be used to describe sequential steps. e.g. We went to dinner. Then we went to a movie.,vocabulary
then (at that time in the future),cependant; This is not a commonly used word but it is the appropriate word when you want to express that you will do something at a time in the future (cependant) instead of doing something because of a cause (alors) or doing something after something else (puis).,vocabulary
I will finish. Use futur simple.,Je finirai. (finir is the infinitive + ai to agree with je),verbs
I will finish it (masculine). Use futur simple.,Je le ('zszszszluh') finirai.; All pronouns representing objects of the verb are placed before the verb in futur simple.; When JE is followed by an L it does not sound like 'shhhh'. Instead it sounds closer to an English J 'zszszszs'. But it is still a long slow sound without forming a separate syllable.,verbs
You will go out. Use futur simple.,Tu sortiras. (sortir is the infinitive + as to agree with tu),verbs
You (plural/formal) will sing. Use futur simple.,Vous chanterez. (chanter is the infinitive + ez to agree with vous),verbs
They will arrive tonight. Use futur simple.,Ils arriveront ce soir.,verbs
I will take. Use futur simple.,Je prendrai.; For verbs that end in -e (like PRENDRE) we remove the -e from the infinitive before applying the same futur simple endings to agree with the subject.; PRENDR + AI,verbs
They will put. Use futur simple.,Ils mettront.; Follows the same pattern as PRENDRE.; 'muh-tron' because -ont is still pronounced in this form.,verbs
We will wait. Use futur simple.,On attendra.; Attendre is the infinitive. It ends in -e so subtract the -e. Then add the -a ending for il/elle/on.; ATTENDR + A,verbs
I will come tomorrow. Use futur simple.,Je viendrai demain.; This is an example of a verb that is irregular in futur simple. The infinitive for 'to come' is VENIR. But we change it to VIENDR and then add the futur simple endings.,verbs
You will go. Use futur simple.,Tu iras.; Aller is irregular in futur simple. The infinitive for 'to go' is ALLER. But we change it to IR and then add the futur simple endings.,verbs
We will go. + They will go. Use futur simple.,On ira (or nous irons). + Ils iront.,verbs
I will go. He would go.,J'irai (indicatif futur simple). Il irait (conditionnel présent).; NB: The conditionnel présent conjugated forms sounds like the first person (je) conjugated in indicatif futur simple.,verbs
We will run errands (not shopping for luxury goods).,Nous ferons des courses.; Faire is irregular in futur simple. Instead of 'fair' we use the radical 'fer' and then add the endings.,verbs
You (formal/plural) will be in Paris.,Vous serez à Paris.; être is irregular in futur simple. We use 'ser' as the radical and then add the endings.,verbs
She will have a cat.,Elle aura un chat.; Avoir is irregular in futur simple. We use 'aur' as the radical and then add the endings.,verbs
What will you eat? (use futur simple),Que mangeras-tu?,verbs

I will see you (informal). Use futur simple.,Je te verrai.,verbs
I will do it.,Je le ('zszszszluh') ferai.; When JE is followed by an L it does not sound like 'shhhh'. Instead it sounds closer to an English J 'zszszszs'. But it is still a long slow sound without forming a separate syllable.,verbs
We shall see. / We will see.,On verra. (use futur simple); NB: On verra ce que ça donne. = We will see. (the same meaning but more idiomatic),verbs
If I save money then I will travel to Italy.,Si j'economise d'argent puis j'irai à l'Italie.; The first phrase is in indicatif présent because it is a hypothesis. The second phrase is in indicatif futur simple because it is something that will certainly happen if the hypothesis is met.,verbs
I will work more if I travel less.,Je traveillerai plus si je voyage moins.; The first phrase is indicatif futur simple because it happens in the future if the hypothesis (the second phrase in indicatif présent) is met.,verbs
Is it possible for the futur simple to follow the word SI (if) directly?,It is possible if the SI indicates 'whether or not something will happen' instead of indicating a hypothesis ('if something happens').;e.g. Je ne sais pas SI je partirai. = I do not know IF (yes/no) I will leave (futur simpl directly follows the SI). Si je pars... = IF I leave... (hypothesis so présent directly follows the SI),verbs
I will not eat butter any more. (use futur simple),Je NE mangerai PLUS de beurre.; 'no more' is a defined quantity so use generic DE (instead of partitive articles).; This is one way to express that you will stop doing something in the future.,verbs
I will not eat butter or bread. (use futur simple),Je NE mangerai PAS de beurre NI de pain.; A lack or negative quantity is still a defined quantity. So use generic DE (instead of partitive articles).; Use NI instead of ET when you are are negating multiple items.; This is another way to express that you will stop doing something in the future.,verbs
I will never eat butter. (use futur simple),Je NE mangerai JAMAIS de beurre.; 'none ever' is a defined quantity so use generic DE (instead of partitive articles).; This is one way to express that you will stop doing something in the future. JAMAIS replaces PAS.,verbs
I will stop eating butter. (use futur simple),J'arrêterai manger de beurre.; This is another way to express that you will stop doing something in the future.,verbs
I will stop. (use futur simple),Je m'arrêterai.; When you use arrêter and you do not specify what you are stopping then you must use the reflexive form of the verb (S'ARRÊTER) to explain that you are stopping yourself ...from doing something. You cannot just say: J'arrête.,verbs
The water stopped.,L'eau s'est arrêté.; We use the reflexive form of the verb (S'ARRÊTER) because some subject has to stop the water - it can't be ambiguous. In this case the water is stopping itself. But if we were more explicit about what stopped the water (or turned it off) then we could use the non-reflexive form of ARRÊTER. e.g. Elle a arrêté l'eau. = She stopped the water.,verbs
He stopped the car.,Il a arreté DE la voiture.;Subject + ARRÊTER + DE + Object (with article). You must use preposition DE.; In this case the object (the thing that is stopped) is explicit. So we do not need to use the reflexive form of the verb (S'ARRÊTER).,verbs
How do you construct the 'indicatif passé composé' verb tense?,AUXILIARY VERB (être or avoir conjugated au présent) + PARTICIPE PASSÉ of the main verb; If être is the auxiliary (helper) verb then the participe passé must also agree with the subject in number and gender. Generally if the auxiliary is avoir then the participe passé does not agree in gender/number. There are some exceptions.,verbs
When should you use indicatif passé composé (instead of indicatif imparfait)?,Use it for actions that occurred in the past. It should be used for anything that can be placed in a chronology - anything that advances a story. It should definitely be used to conclude a story. It should be used for an action that interupts the setting/background (e.g. the phone rang).,verbs
How does the treatment of objects change when you are using indicatif passé composé (compared to indicatif imparfait)?,Phrases in passé composé must always be able to stand alone. So you cannot omit an object (or a pronoun that represents an object) of the phrase.; But when you are using imparfait to describe the context of a story then you are allowed to be a little vague (to build suspense) because you will eventually need to conclude with a complete phrase in passé composé.,verbs
Generally how is the participe passé formed for 1) regular -ER verbs 2) irregular -RE verbs?,1) -ER verbs: radical + É (e.g. parler becomes parlé). This group sounds exactly the same as the 2nd person plural (vous) au présent.; 2) -RE verbs: radical + IS (e.g. prendre becomes pris. mettre become mis. comprendre becomes compris.),verbs
Generally how is the participe passé formed for 1) regular -IR verbs 2) irregular verbs ending -RIR  3) irregular verbs ending -IRE?,1) regular -IR verbs: radical + i (e.g. partir becomes parti); 2) irregular -RIR verbs: radical + ert (e.g. ouvrir becomes ouvert. souffrir becomes souffert.); 3) irregular -IRE verbs: radical + IT (e.g. conduire becomes conduit. écrire becomes écrit. dire becomes dit.),verbs
Generally how is the participe passé formed for -OIR verbs?,radical + U (e.g. pouvoir becomes pu. vouloir becomes voulu. courir becomes couru.),verbs

They studied.,Ils ont étudié.; étudier is a regular -ER verb. The radical is 'étudi' - not 'étud'.,verbs
They did not study.; Specify common pronunciation.,When writing: Ils n'ont pas étudié.; When speaking the NE portion of negation is optional: Ils‿ont pas étudié. There is now an obligatory liaison between Ils and ont - even though gramatically there should be an NE there.,verbs
I did not study., Je n'ai pas étudié.; You do not need to add DE after PAS when what follows is a verb. This is different from nouns. e.g. Je n'ai pas DE pommes.; In passé composé PAS is placed between the auxiliary and the past participle. It is the only word that comes between those two parts of the verb.,verbs
All in passé composé: I read. / I read it. / I did not read it.,J'ai lu. / Je l'ai lu. / Je ne l'ai pas lu.; Lire changes to Lu for past participle.,verbs
I learn. / I learned., J'apprends. ('juh-prawn') / J'ai appris. ('jay ah-pree'),verbs

You were able (to pay).,Tu a pu (payer).; Pouvoir is the infinitive (to be able to). Pouvoir uses avoir in passé composé and the participle for all subjects is pu.; NB: pouVOIR is the infinitive so it should be conjugated exactly the same as VOIR (to see).,verbs
Which 5 verbs have a completely irregular past particle?,avoir (eu) + être (été) + faire (fait) + offrir (offert) + ouvrir (ouvert); NB: All of these use AVOIR as the auxiliary in passé composé and plus que parfait.,verbs
He had. / He was. / He did (something).,Il a eu. / Il a été. / Il a fait.; All the 5 verbs with an irregular past participle use AVOIR as the auxiliary verb in passé composé.,verbs
How do you express: There is... (present) + There was/were... (past),There are... =  Il y a...; There was/were... = Il y avais...  Generally imparfait is the better choice for this phrase in the past because you are describing the scene. But there are examples where passé composé is better (Il y a eu...).,verbs
How do you express: There will be... (future),Two options depending on context. 1) Futur simple: Il y aura... = There will be....  2) Futur proche: Il y va avoir = There's gonna be...,verbs
There may be a thunderstorm.,Il peut y avoir un orage.; Take the present tense (Il y a...) and change to use the helper verb pouvoir: Il peut y avoir...,verbs

How do you negate a phrase in passé composé?,NE comes directly after the subject. PAS is placed between the auxiliary and the past participle (like all adverbs).; e.g. We did not do X. = Nous n'avons pas fait X.; Nothing else (except adverbs) are ever placed between the auxiliary and the past participle.,verbs
He did not read. + They did not run.,Il N'a PAS lu. + Ils N'ont PAS couru.; In passé compose: NE is placed directly after the subject (before any pronouns). PAS is placed between the auxiliary and past participle.,verbs
I did not travel a lot.,Je N'ai PAS BEAUCOUP voyagé.; In passé composé: Adverbs (like beaucoup) are placed between the auxiliary and past participle - with PAS.,vocabulary
I have not yet finished.,Je n'ai pas ENCORE fini.; Encore can mean 'yet' or 'even'.; Adverbs (like encore) are placed between the auxiliary and the past participle - with PAS.,verbs
idiomatic way to express: I was running all week.,J'enchaine. = I'm really busy doing one thing after another; enchainer = to do one thing after another (like chain smoking); You could also say: J'ai couru toute la semaine. = I ran all week long (literally).,conversation
She pinched her finger.,Elle s'est pincé (not pincée) le doight.; If a reflexive verb is followed by an object then the participe passé does not agree in gender/number with the subject.,verbs
She injured herself while riding a bike.,Elle s'est blessée (agreement) en faisant du vélo.; The reflexive verb is not followed directly by an object so the participe passé still must agree in gender/number with the subject.,verbs
What the three characteristics that lead to a verb using être in passé composé?,1) a verb that describes movement of an animate object (e.g. la maison de être = verbs that describe a person's movement in/around a home) 2) a verb that describes a change of state (e.g. naître + mourir + devenir = to become something) 3) Any verbs that is being used in a reflexive way (e.g. SE PROMENER); NB: An acronym to remember the 15 base verbs is MRS VANDERTRAMPP.; Remember that when être is the auxiliary verb then the past participle must agree with the subject in gender and number.,verbs
What are the 15 verbs that use être in passé composé (a past tense)?,Monter Retourner Sortir Venir (e.g. includes devenir + revenir + etc.) Arriver Naître Descendre Entrer Rentrer Tomber Rester Aller Mourir Partir Passer; Remember that when être is the auxiliary verb then the past participle must agree with the subject in gender and number.; Some verbs can use both être and avoir as auxiliaries but the choice changes the meaning.,verbs
When do we use avoir (instead of être) as auxiliary in passé composé for the 15 verbs that typically use être?,If the COD of the verb is a location then we are using the verb in the positional sense which dictates être as auxiliary. e.g. Je suis passé devant le magasin. = I passed in front of the store.; If the COD of the verb is an object then we are using the verb in a non-positional sense which dictates avoir as auxiliary. e.g. J'ai passé un bon moment. = I had a good time.,verbs
Conjugate 'to arrive' in passé composé.,ARRIVER is the infinitive; Je suis arrivé(e) (m/f) + Tu es arrivé(e) (m/f) + Il/Elle/On est arrivé(e) (m/f) + Nous sommes arrivés + Vous êtes arrivés + Ils/Elles sont arrivé(e)s; explanation: arriver uses être in passé composé. So we conjugate être for the auxiliary. Then the past participle must agree with the subject.,verbs
I leave. + I left (a place).,Je pars. + Je suis parti(e).; PARTIR is not a regular -IR verb. Nous partONS. - not Nous partissons.; PARTIR uses être in passé composé so the past participle must agree with the subject.; Think of partir as 'parting' from something.,verbs
I go out of the apartment. + I went out.,Je sors du appartement. + Je SUIS sorti(e) du appartment.; SORTIR is not a regular -IR verb in the present tense.; SORTIR uses être in passé composé (when it is being used to describe the position of the subject) so the past participle must agree with the subject.; la sortie = the exit. SORTIR + DE = to go out from OR to take out from.,verbs
I take my gloves out of the box. + I took my gloves out of the box.,Je sors mes gants de la boîte. + J'AI sorti mes gants de la boîte.; SORTIR generally uses être as auxiliary but in this case we are using SORTIR to describe an action (not the position of the subject) so we use avoir as auxiliary.; SORTIR + DE = to go out from OR to take out from.,verbs
They (all feminine) went online to learn.,Elles sont allées en ligne.; Aller uses être in passé composé and so it must agree with the subject (Ils sont allés. vs Elles sont allées.),verbs
You come from the country. + You came from the country.,Tu viens de la campagne. + Tu es venu(e) de la campagne.; VENIR (to come) uses être in passé composé so the participe passé must agree with the subject (venu if masculine + venue if feminine).,verbs
We came home to our place. + We brought the table into our place.,On EST rentrés chez nous. + On A rentré la table chez nous.; RENTRER (to come back) generally uses être as auxiliary (the first phrase). But if we use RENTRER to describe something other than the position of the subject then we use avoir as auxiliary and that means that the participe passé no longer agrees with subject (second phrase).,verbs
I entered the bedroom. + I inserted the key into the lock.,Je SUIS entré(e) dans la chambre. + J'AI entré la clé dans la serrure.; ENTRER (to enter) generally uses être as auxiliary (the first phrase). But if we use ENTRER to describe something other than the position of the subject then we use avoir as auxiliary and that means that the participe passé no longer agrees with subject (second phrase).,verbs
I climbed the stairs. + I put up the suitcases.,Je SUIS monté(e) les escaliers. +  J'AI monté les valises.; Monter with auxiliare être (participe passé agrees) = to go up / to take oneself up.

I got off the bus. + I took down the bottle from the shelf.,Je SUIS descendu(e) du bus. + J'AI descendu la bouteille de l'étagère.; DESCENDRE (to go down / to descend) generally uses être as auxiliary (the first phrase). But if we use DESCENDRE to describe something other than the position of the subject then we use avoir as auxiliary and that means that the participe passé no longer agrees with subject (second phrase).,verbs
The mosque was turned towards the museum. + He turned the page of the book.,La mosquée EST tournée vers la musée. + Il A tourné la page du livre.; TOURNER generally uses avoir in passé composé (which is the case in the second phrase).

That means that the participe passé must agree in gender/number with the subject.,verbs
What are the only two verbs that use être in passé composé AND are irregular in passé composé?,naître (to be born) and mourir (to die) - e.g. Je suis né(e) + Il/Elle est mort(e).; NB: Any verb can be made into a reflexive verb. So if a verb (that normally uses avoir in passé composé) is used reflexively in passé composé then it might be an additional case of an irregular être verb in passé composé.,verbs
They (all men / all women) died.,Ils sont morts. / Elles sont mortes.;Mourir (to die) uses être in passé composé which means that the participle must agree with the subject.,verbs
She/he was born on XX/XX/XXX. He was born.,Elle/il est né(e) le XX/XX/XXXX.; Naître (to be born) uses être in passé composé so the past participle must agree with the subject.; Place LE before any date because all dates are masculine nouns.,verbs
You (formal and informal) were born in XXXX,Vous êtes / Tu es né(e) à/en/au/aux XXXX.; à for a city; en/au/aux for a country following aller + rester + partir.,verbs
What are 3 alternative ways to say I was born in Paris (without using the verb naître)?,Je suis natif de Paris. + Je suis parisienne de naissance. + Je suis paname.; Paname is a slang word for Paris.,verbs
the city where I was born,la ville OÙ je suis né(e); Use the relative pronoun OÙ to represent a time or place (where or when). This is different than when you start a phrase with 'when'. e.g. when i was 10 years old = QUAND j'avais 10 ans,pronouns
France is a good place to live.,La France est un bon endroit OÙ vivre.; Use pronom où (where) in this case - instead of DE.,pronouns
the season when it is hottest,la saison OÙ il fait plus chaud; Use the relative pronoun OÙ to represent a time or place (where or when).,pronouns
the moment when I saw it,le moment ('momo') OÙ je l'ai vu; Use the relative pronoun OÙ to represent a time or place (where or when).,pronouns
My cousin had a son.,Use AVOIR in passé composé: Mon cousin a eu un fils.,verbs
How do you construct the 'indicatif passé composé' verb tense for reflexive verbs?,All reflexive verbs use être as a helper verb (regardless of whether or not they use être in the non-reflexive form). SUBJECT + PRONOUN (me/te/...) + ÊTRE CONJUGATED + PAST PARTICIPLE OF THE VERB; NB: We are using être as the auxiliary verb in these reflexive cases so the past participle must agree with the subject.,verbs
Yesterday I got up at 8am.,Hier je me suis levé(e) à 8h.,verbs
You (masc / fem) went to sleep late last night.,Tu t'es couché / couchée tard hier soir (or la nuit dernière).; Se coucher is reflexive so we use être as auxiliary and then the past participle agrees with the subject.; NB: In this case t'es is a required contraction of the pronoun TE and the verb EST. But in conversation it is not uncommon for the french to contract the subject TU and the verb EST. e.g. T'es gentil(e). = You are nice. Do not use this in formal communication but you will hear it in informal communication.,verbs
I help you.,Je t'aide.; pronouns that are direct objects come BEFORE the verb in French,verbs
I helped you.,Je t'ai aidé.; In the past tense the direct object pronoun comes BEFORE BOTH the helper verb and the action verb.,verbs
He helped us. / I helped them.,Il nous a aidé. / Je les ai aidé.,verbs
Can you (formal) help me? + Would you help me?,Pouvez-vous m'aider? (indicatif présent) + Pourriez-vous m'aider? (conditionnel présent); The latter is more polite because it uses the conditionnel mood.,verbs
Can you (informal) hear me?,Peux tu m'entendre?,verbs
Can I ...? + May I ...?,Pourrais-je ('poo-rayj')...? Use POUVOIR in the conditionnel mood to be polite in formal and informal settings.; Rarely used alternative: Puis-je ('poo-eej') ...? This is the present tense (je peux) inverted. We cannot say peux-je because of vowels so we revert to an ancient form of the word (je puis). This is not common. It sounds weird in everyday settings. Do not use it.,verbs
May I help you?,Pourrais-je vous aider? Use POUVOIR in the conditionnel mood to be polite in formal and informal settings.; Alternative you may hear: Comment puis-je ('poo-eej') vous aider? = How can I help you? using inversion of the ancient form je puis. A vendor in a store may use this to be overly polite but it sounds weird in everyday conversation.,verbs
He gives to me. + He gave to me. + He will give to me.,Il me donne. + Il m'a donné. + Il va me donner.; In futur proche (conjugated ALLER + infinitive) pronouns that are objects of the verb - direct and indirect - are placed in between the conjugated ALLER and the infinitive.,verbs
You told me multiple times.,Tu me l'as dit plusieurs fois.; Tu (You) me (to me) le (it) as (auxiliary AVOIR because NOT reflexive and uses 'to tell' uses avoir) dit (past participle of dire); NB: In French you cannot just say 'You told me.' You must refer to what it is that was told (You told IT to me.) ...even if you use a pronoun and even if you already described it in a previous sentence.; Both the direct and indirect object pronouns come before the verb.,verbs
I remembered it. + I did not remember it.,Je m'en suis souvenu(e). + Je ne m'en suis pas souvenu(e).; To form the past tense look at the infinitive (se souvenir). It is a variation of the verb VENIR. So it has the same ending in past participle: souvenu.; Remember in this case we use 'en' instead of 'le' to represent 'it' because SE SOUVENIR triggers DE before the object.,verbs
I thought about something. + I remembered something.,Je pensais (imparfait) à quelque chose. + J'ai pensé à quelque chose.; You can choose between imparfait (something in the past that has changed or is no longer happening) and passé composé (something distinct that happened in the past) to change the meaning of a phrase. There is lots of nuance - it's not black/white.; We almost always use the imparfait to describe something we were thinking in the past because (implicitly) we no longer think the same now.,verbs
I dreamed of a cat. + I dreamed of becoming a doctor (but I did not).,J'ai rêvé (passé composé) d'un chat. + Je revais de devenir médecin.; You can choose between imparfait (something in the past that has changed or is no longer happening) and passé composé (something distinct that happened in the past) to change the meaning of a phrase. There is lots of nuance - it's not black/white.,verbs
I became an engineer. + I almost became a doctor (but I did not).,Je suis devenu(e) (passé composé) ingénieur. + Je devenais (imparfait) médecin.; You can choose between imparfait (something in the past that has changed or is no longer happening) and passé composé (something distinct that happened in the past) to change the meaning of a phrase. There is lots of nuance - it's not black/white.,verbs
When using passé composé (or any other composed verb tense) with AVOIR as the auxiliary` under what circumstances does the participe passé agree in gender/number?,When the direct object of the phrase (or its pronoun) is placed before the verb. In these cases the participe passé must agree in gender/number with the OBJECT (not the subject).; For example: J'ai VU la femme. (No agreement in participe passé because avoir is the auxiliary and a direct object is placed after the verb.) C'est la famme que j'ai VUE. (Participe passé is feminine singular to agree with the object - la femme - because avoir is the auxiliary and the object is placed before the verb.,verbs
He ate them.,Il les (masc pl) a mangéS (masc pl).; This is the special case of passé composé (or any composed tense) where avoir is the auxiliary and a direct object (or its pronoun) is placed before the verb. In those cases the participe passé must agree with the object (not the subject). This often changes the pronunciation of the participe passé.,verbs
It's the apartment that she bought. + It's the house that she bought.,C'est l'appartement qu'elle a acheté (masc sing to agree with appartement). + C'est la maison qu'elle a achetée (fem sing to agree with maison).; The participe passé must agree in gender/number with a DIRECT OBJECT (not the subject) when avoir is the auxiliary and the object is placed before the verb.; This often changes the pronunciation of the participe passé.,verbs
the apartment that my father constructed + the house that my father constructed; Specify pronunciation.,l'appartement (masc sing) que mon père a construit ('kohn-stwee') + la maison (fem sing) que mon père a construitE ('kohn-stweeT'); This is the special case of passé composé (or any composed tense) where avoir is the auxiliary and a direct object (or its pronoun) is placed before the verb. In those cases the participe passé must agree with the object (not the subject). This often changes the pronunciation of the participe passé.,verbs
the box that I opened; Specify pronunciation.,la boîte que j'ai ouvertE ('oo-verT'); This is the special case of passé composé (or any composed tense) where avoir is the auxiliary and a direct object (or its pronoun) is placed before the verb. In those cases the participe passé must agree with the object (not the subject). This often changes the pronunciation of the participe passé.,verbs
the flowers that you offered to Simone; Specify pronunciation.,les fleurs (fem pl) que tu as offertES ('oh-fehrT') à Simone; This is the special case of passé composé (or any composed tense) where avoir is the auxiliary and a direct object (or its pronoun) is placed before the verb. In those cases the participe passé must agree with the object (not the subject). This often changes the pronunciation of the participe passé.,verbs
the flowers that you gave + the flowers of which you spoke; Specify spelling of the participe passé.,les fleurs (fem pl) que tu as donnéES (fem pl) + les fleurs DONT tu as parlé (masc sing).; The first phrase is the case of composed tenses where a direct object (the flowers) is placed before the verb AND avoir is the auxiliary. So the participe passé must agree in gender/number with the direct object.; The second phrase resembles that case butthe object is not a direct object. So the participe passé does NOT agree in gender/number with the object. The object (the flowers) is the object of a prepositional phrase: Tu as parle DE les fleurs. The use of DONT is the hint here.,verbs
What is the 'indicatif imparfait' verb tense?,Imparfait tense is used for happenings in the past (not the present) that do not advance the story (do not fit strictly into a chronology): a situation + scene + state of being + habit + feelings + thoughts. 1) Something in the past with a continuing/ambigous time frame. e.g. telling a story / sharing a memory  2) Adding context/setting/details (not actions) to a story in the past  3) Something that happened habitually in the past (habits)  4) Something that was true in the past but is no longer true in the present (e.g. When you thought something in the past but now you think differently.),verbs
How do you construct the 'indicatif imparfait' verb tense?,For -ER and -IR verbs: RADICAL of the infinitive in the NOUS form + imparfait endings (je -ais + tu -ais + il -ait + nous -ions + vous -iez + ils -aient); There is no auxiliary/helper verb (as in passé composé).; NB: For all -ER verbs 'imparfait' sounds exactly the same as the infinitive for ALL subjects (except nous and vous forms)!!; NB: The endings (not the base) for the indicatif imparfait and conditionnel présent tenses are exactly the same.,verbs
What are the two english phrases that - when translated - almost always use 'imparfait' tense?,I was (doing something) + I used to (do something) ...for any subject; Note how these indicate something in the past without a defined beginning and end / was or used to be but is no longer / was habitual.,verbs
I bought it at the store. + I was buying it... (when something else happened).,Je l'ai acheté (indicatif passé composé) au magasin. + Je l'achetais (indicatif imparfait)...; The second phrase is in l'imparfait because it describes context instead of an action that advances the story.,verbs
I walked on the beach. + I used to walk on the beach.,J'ai marché (indicatif passé composé) sur la plage. + Je marchais (indicatif imparfait) sur la plage.; The second phrase is in l'imparfait because it describes an habitual action in the past.,verbs
How do you determine whether to conjugate in indicatif passé composé vs imparfait?,Use passé composé for ACTION (or reaction) that advances a story. These phrases could be placed in a timeline/chronology. Often these are punctuated actions with clear start/end.; Use imparfait for DESCRIPTION to enrich the context or provide detail (e.g. weather). Use imparfait for habitual/repetitive activities in the past and activities in the past without a clear start/finish.; If the phrase doesn't fit into the chronology of the story then it probably should be conjugated in imparfait.,verbs
Conjugate marcher (to walk) in the 'imparfait' tense (I was walking + You were walking + etc).,First determine présent nous form: nous MARCHons. Then subtract the ending so radical = MARCH; Now add the endings to the radical: Je marchais + Tu marchais + Il/Elle/On marchait + Nous marchions + Vous marchiez + Ils/Elles marchaient; NB: Marcher is a regular -ER verb so all the imparfait forms (except nous and vous) sound exactly the same as the infinitive - though they are spelled differently.,verbs
I ate. / I was eating.,J'ai mangé. / Je mangeais.; Both are pronounced exactly the same as the infinitive.; Manger is a regular -ER verb all the 'imparfait' conjugations (except nous and vous) sound exactly the same as the infinitive - though they are spelled differently.,verbs
You (informal) ate. / You (informal) were eating.,Tu a mangé. / Tu mangeais.; Both are pronounced exactly the same as the infinitive.; Manger is a regular -ER verb all 'imparfait' conjugations (except nous and vous) sound exactly the same as the infinitive - though they are spelled differently.,verbs
You (formal) ate. / You (formal) ate.,Vous avez mangé. ('mon-jay') / Vous mangiez. ('mon-jee-ay'); Only passé composé is pronounced the same as the infinitive because the subject is vous.; Manger is a regular -ER verb all 'imparfait' conjugations (except nous and vous) sound exactly the same as the infinitive - though they are spelled differently.,verbs
She was waiting for me. + She was waiting for me to finish.,Elle m'attendait. (no preposition between the verb 'to wait' and the person/thing you are waiting for) + Elle attendais que je finisse. (Use subjonctif in this case.),verbs
Conjugate être (to be) in the 'imparfait' tense (I was + You were + He was + We were + You guys were + They were),J'étais ('jeh-tay') + Tu étais ('tu-eh-tay' OR 'teh-tay' but always spelled as two words) + Il/Elle était ('eh-tay') + Nous étions ('eh-teeon')+ Vous étiez ('eh-teeay')+ Ils/Elles étaient ('eh-tay'),verbs
I was happy.,J'étais heureux/heureuse.; You automatically use the imparfait (instead of passé composé) because you are describing a state of being in the past.,verbs
Conjugate avoir (to have) in the imparfait tense (I was having + You were having + He was having + We were having + You guys were having + They were having),j'avais + tu avais + il avait + nous avions + vous aviez + ils avaient,verbs
Conjugate savoir (to know) in the imparfait.,the same as AVOIR - just add an S in front of them all,verbs
Conjugate voir (to see) in the imparfait.,Different than AVOIR. je voyais + tu voyais + il voyait + nous voyions + vous voyiez + ils voyaient,verbs
to recognize/acknowledge,reconnaître; It is CONNAÎTRE (to be familiar with) with the prefix RE-.,verbs
to get to know (someone),apprendre à connaître (quelqu'un); This phrase only works with getting to know someone. If you mean 'to get to know some thing' then you must use S'HABITUER (to get used to),verbs
I got to know him at work.,J'ai appris à le connaitre au travail.; le = him because it is a direct object in this case.,verbs
to be used to something,AVOIR l'habitude À quelque chose; This is different from describing the action of getting used to something (S'HABITUER).,verbs
to get used to something,Many options: 1) S'HABITUER À quelque chose  2) PRENDRE l'habitude  3) AVOIR l'habitude = to be used to something already  4) DEVOIR habituer = to be required to get used to something,verbs
I adapt (to a new situation).,Je me suis adapter.; Must use the reflexive form of the verb.,verbs

They are used to reading content online. + They got used to reading content online.,Ils ont (AVOIR) l'habitude à lire du contenu en ligne. + Ils se sont habitués (S'HABITUER)...; These two sentiments are different enough that they require different verbs.,verbs
I am getting used to walking to work.,Je m'habitue (S'HABITUER) à marcher (infinitive) pour aller au travail.; In english when we want to use a verb as a noun (walking in this case) then we add -ING (e.g. I like dancing.) But in french we cannot use a verb as a noun. If we need a noun then we use the infinitive. (e.g. J'aime danser. = I like to dance.),verbs
to blend in,se fondre dans la masse,vocabulary
Before... I went out every night.,Avant... je sortais tous les soirs.; 'i went' is the flag to use the 'imparfait'. But also when 'avant' is used in this way then you can expect 'imparfait' to follow it.,verbs
In the mornings I ate eggs. + Frequently I ate eggs.,Le matin je mangeais des œufs. +  Souvent je mangeais des œufs.; Both of these phrases suggested something that was habitually done in the past (not just once). Therefore we use imparfait in both cases.,verbs
I used to play tetris.,Je jouais ('zshoo-ay') au tetris.; Use imparfait because in this case 'used to' means an activity in the past that was done repeatedly that is no longer happening - not to become accustomed to something.,verbs
I used to make coffee.,Je faisais ('fez-ay') du café.; Use imparfait because in this case 'used to' means an activity in the past that was done repeatedly that is no longer happening - not to become accustomed to something.,verbs
I am used to sleeping a long time.,Je suis habitué(e) (SE HABITUER) À dormir longtemps. OR J'ai l'habitude DE dormir longtemps.; Être habitué(e) requires preposition À. Avoir l'habitude requires preposition DE.; In this case 'used to' means that you got accustomed to something (in the past). So use passé composé. It is not an activity that was done repeatedly.,verbs
I am used to swimming.,Je suis habitué(e) (SE HABITUER) À nager. OR J'ai l'habitude DE nager.; Être habitué(e) requires preposition À. Avoir l'habitude requires preposition DE.; In this case 'used to' means that you got accustomed to something (in the past). So use passé composé. It is not an activity that was done repeatedly.,verbs
Which verbs almost always use the imparfait tense (instead of passé composé) when used in the past tense? Why?,penser + savoir + connaitre + vouloir + pouvoir + devoir; When you use these verbs in the past you almost mean that you thought/knew/wanted/etc something but that you no longer think/knew/want it now - the scenario has changed. That is why we almost always use imparfait for these verbs in the past tense. But be careful. Choosing imparfait vs passé composé depends on how the phrase is being used.,verbs
My mother wanted to see the horse.,Ma mère voulait voir le cheval.; The infinitive is VOULOIR (to want). Conjugate vouloir in the imparfait because you are implying that she wanted something in the past but may not want the same thing in the present. For this reason... VOULOIR is almost always conjugated in imparfait (instead of passé composé) in the past.,verbs
It was 3:00pm. I saw an elephant.,Il était 15 heures. J'ai vu un éléphant.; The first sentence describes the setting so use imparfait. The second sentence describes a discrete action so use passé composé.,verbs
What is the 'conditionnel' verb mood? Which tenses does it contain?,Conditionnel verb mood expresses a hypothetical action that depends on something else being true. Contionnel mood has two verb tenses: conditionnel présent (could/should/would) and conditionnel passé (could have / should have / would have),verbs
What is the 'conditionnel présent' verb tense?,e.g. I would / could / should (do something). It expresses a hypothetical situation. There is uncertainty with a condition - you would do something IF something else were true. The accompanying IF statement may be implied.; The word IF cannot be used in the same phrase as you use the conditionnel mood because that would duplicate the hypothetical. e.g. I would do it... if I have time. = Je le ferrais (conditionnel présent)... si j'ai (indicatif présent) le temps.,verbs
When should you use the conditionnel présent verb tense?,1) to be polite (e.g. je voudrais) 2) to express a wish 3) to give advice (tu devrais) 4) to share information that is not confirmed (e.g. news article); NB: You can also use the imparfait to be polite in the present: Je voulais un cafe. = I would like a coffee. (in a very polite way),verbs
How do you construct the 'conditionnel présent' verb tense?,Use the same radical as the futur simple (the entire infinitive or modified infinitive - typically with R). Then add the imparfait endings to agree with subject: je -ais + tu -ais + il/elle/on -ait + nous -ions + vous -iez + ils/elles -aient; NB: Almost all of the conditionnel présent conjugations (je/tu/il/ils) sound exactly the same as the first person singular (je) form for indicatif futur simple (though spelled differently).; But the nous and vous forms are pronounced differently.,verbs
I would like some milk.,Je voudrais DU lait.; Vouloir (to want) is conjugated in the conditionnel mood for politeness.,verbs
I would like to find...,Je voudrais trouver...; Vouloir (to want) is conjugated in the conditionnel mood for politeness.,verbs
How do you express: I could / may / might (do something).,Je POURRais faire quelque chose.; POUVOIR (to be able to) in the conditionnel présent + infinitive of the action verb,verbs
How do you express: I should (do something).,Je DEVRais ('shduh-vray'; Je can contract in front of any verb) faire quelque chose.; DEVOIR (to must) in the conditionnel présent + infinitive of the action verb,verbs
How do you express: I must (do something).,Je DOIS ('shdwah'; Je can contract in front of any verb) faire quelque chose.; Use DEVOIR (to must) in the présent tense!! ... not the condtionnel tense,verbs
How do you express: I had (to do something).,Je DEVais ('shduh-vray'; Je can contract in front of any verb) faire quelque chose.; DEVOIR (to must) in the imparfait + infinitive of the action verb. Use imparfait because telling a story.; If you really needed to use passé composé (e.g. if you were stating a conclusion to past activity) then it would be: J'ai du (past participle of devoir) faire quelque chose.,verbs
How do you express: I didn't need (something).,Je n'AVAIS pas besoin quelque chose.; Use AVOIR BESOIN in the imparfait tense because telling a story.; There is no second infinitive verb when you use avoir besoin.,verbs
How do you express: I want you (to do something). + I wanted you (to do something).,This triggers subjonctif because it expresses a desire that may or may not reflect reality: Je veux QUE tu fasses quelque chose. + Je voulais QUE tu fasses quelque chose.; Remember that VOUDRAIS is the same verb. Any time you say: Je voudrais que... followed by a phrase - then that phrase must be in subjonctif.,verbs
idiomatic way to express: I have to do it.; Specify pronunciation.,Il faut que je fasse ça. It is pronounced very quickly and squished together: 'foh-tkuh-shfahs',verbs
idiomatic way to express: I don't have to do it.,Je n'ai pas À faire ça.; Less idiomatic option: Je ne dois faire pas ça.,conversation
I will be able to. (indicatif futur simple) / I could. (conditionnel présent),Je pourrai. / Je pourrais.; Pronounced exactly the same ('pour-ray') because je/tu/il/elle/on/ils/elles in conditionnel présent sound exactly the same as je in futur simple - though spelled differently.; Remember 'ai' sounds like 'ay' in french - like j'ai.,verbs
I will eat. (indicatif futur simple) / They would eat. (conditionnel présent),Je mangerai. / Ils mangeraient.; Pronounced exactly the same ('man-jer-ray') because je/tu/il/elle/on/ils/elles in conditionnel présent sound exactly the same as je in futur simple - though spelled differently.; -ent is always silent on verbs,verbs
I will have more time. (indicatif futur simple) / I will know how to do it. (indicatif futur simple),J'aurai plus DE temps. / Je saurai comment faire.; NB: AVOIR and SAVOIR are usually conjugated in the same way - just add an S to the front for the SAVOIR version.,verbs
Elle has been working longer than me.,Elle travaille depuis plus longtemps que moi.,vocabulary
We didn't have enough time.,On n'a pas eu assez DE temps.; Even though temps is an exception when negated... (e.g. Je n'ai pas LE temps. = I do not have time.)... There is no exception when expressing equivalence.,verbs
It took too long.,Ça a pris trop DE temps.; Use DE (instead of LE temps). The only time that le temps over-rides the generic DE is when it is negated with PAS (pas le temps).,vocabulary
It took 30 minutes.,Ça a pris 30 minutes.,verbs
I quit. / I will quit. / I would quit.,J'ai quitté. / Je quitterai. / Je quitterais.; QUITTER is the infinitive. It also means 'to leave'.,verbs
Using the verb ÉCOUTER... You would listen. / He would listen. (both conditionnel présent),Tu écouterais. / Il écouterait.; ('ay-coo-tuh-ray') Both sound exactly the same as Je version in futur simple (j'écouterai) - though they are spelled differently.,verbs
Using the verb CHANTER... They would sing. / You (formal/plural) would sing. (both conditionnel présent),Ils chanteraient. ('shon-tu-ray') / Vous chanteriez. ('shon-tu-ree-ay'); The ils version sounds exactly the same as the je version in futur simple (je chanterai) BUT the vous version sounds different because nous and vous versions do not follow the rule that je/tu/il/elle/on/ils/elles follow.,verbs
Using the verb VOIR... She would watch. / We (nous) would watch. (both conditionnel présent),Elle verrait. / Nous verrions.; VOIR is irregular in futur simple - we use the radical 'verr'.; Note that the pronunciation rule still holds: Elle verrait (She would watch) sounds the same as Je verrai (I will watch). BUT Nous verrions (We would watch) does not sound the same as Je verrai (I will watch) because nous and vous never follow the pronunciation rule.,verbs
You (familiar) would go. / You (formal/plural) would go. (both futur conditionnel présent),Tu irais. / Vous iriez.; ALLER is irregular in futur simple - we use the radical 'ir'.; The pronunciation similarities still hold. Tu irais (You would go) sounds the same as J'irai (I will go). Vous form sounds different - always does.,verbs
What is the 'conditionnel passé' verb tense?,The conditionnel mood (a hypothesis) in the past tense. It is used to express: a regret/remorse + a rapproche (scolding someone) + uncertainty (journalists use it to report unconfirmed information).; To compare: conditionnel présent (a hypothetical action) is should do/ could do / would do. Conditionnel passé is the same but in the past: should have done / could have done / would have done.; For example: I would have returned the book (IF I had had time). The first phrase is conditionnel passé. The second phrase could be said or omitted.,verbs
How do you construct the 'conditionnel passé' verb tense?,AVOIR/ÊTRE conjugated in conditionnel présent + past participle; e.g. I would have done something. = J'AURAIS FAIT quelque chose.; The past participle is the same as passé composé. The pairing with avoir/être is the same as passé composé.,verbs
I would receive. + I would have received.,Je reçevrais (conditionnel présent). + J'aurais reçu (conditionnel passé).,verbs
I would have written a letter.,J'aurais écrit une lettre.; This is hypothetical in the past so use conditionnel passé (AVOIR/ÊTRE conjugated in conditionnel présent + past participle).,verbs
They would have gone to the movies.,Ils seraient allés au cinéma.; This is hypothetical in the past so use conditionnel passé.,verbs
I would have liked to discuss it with the saleswoman.,J'aurais voulu/aimée (conditionnel passé) en discuter avec la vendeuse.,verbs
He would have become a doctor. + He would have liked to become a doctor.,Il serait devenu (conditionnel passé) un médecin. + Il aurait aimée (conditionnel passé) devenir (2nd verb) médecin.; Both sentences are conditionnel passé. In the first sentence the conjugated verb is devenir. In the second sentence the conjugated verb is aimer (so devenir remains as infinitive).,verbs
I could have seen the coral reef.,J'aurais pu voir le récif de corail.; Use conditionnel passé (AVOIR/ÊTRE conjugated in conditionnel présent + past participle) to describe what should or could or would have happened.,verbs
She could have gone to the movies.,Elle aurait pu (conditionnel passé) aller (infinitive) au cinéma.; This is special variation of conditionnel passé (could have): AVOIR/ÊTRE conjugated in conditionnel présent (aurait) + PAST PARTICIPLE (pu from pouvoir) + INFINITIVE,verbs
I should have taken care of my body.,J'aurais dû prendre soins de mon corps.; Use conditionnel passé (AVOIR/ÊTRE conjugated in conditionnel présent + past participle) to describe what should or could or would have happened.,verbs

You should have listened to me.,Tu aurais dû m'écouter.; Use conditionnel passé (AVOIR/ÊTRE conjugated in conditionnel présent + past participle) to describe what should or could or would have happened.; When speaking tu + aurais contracts to t'aurais. But never contract it in writing.,verbs
We should have sang a song.,On aurait dû (conditionnel passé) chanter (infinitive) une chanson.; This is special variation of conditionnel passé (should have): AVOIR/ÊTRE conjugated in conditionnel présent (aurait) + PAST PARTICIPLE (dû from devoir) + INFINITIVE,verbs

It could be worse. + It could have been worse.,Ça pourrait être pire. (conditionnel présent) + Ça aurait pu être pire. (conditionnel passé),verbs
idiomatic way to express: It can't get any worse.,On ne peut pas descendre plus bas.,conversation
What are the three combinations of tenses that one can use in dependent (If...) / independent phrases?,There are 3 possibilities: 1) imparfait + conditionnel présent 2) plus que parfait + conditionnel passé 3) présent + futur simple; Remember to NEVER EVER use conditionnel mood in the same phrase as SI - it's redundant and very bad form. e.g. Si j'AVais (subordinate clause)... j'AURais (independant clause)... When educated speakers here SI j'AURais... (Si + conditionnel mood) it is like nails on a chalkboard.,verbs
If I had more time... I would dance every day.,Si j'avais (indicatif imparfait) plus de temps... je dancerais (conditionnel présent) tous les jours.; SI and conditionnel mood verbs are never in the same phrase. That would be redundant because conditionnel mood implies the existence of an if-clause.; This example illustrates 1 of 3 possible pairings in French when using independent and dependent clauses: 1) imparfait + conditionnel présent 2) plus que parfait + conditionnel passé 3) présent + futur simple,verbs
If she had been saving money... she would go to the market.,Si elle économisait (indicatif imparfait)... elle irait (conditionnel présent) au marché.; This example illustrates 1 of 3 possible pairings in French when using independent and dependent clauses: 1) imparfait + conditionnel présent 2) plus que parfait + conditionnel passé 3) présent + futur simple; Never use SI + conditionnel (it's redundant and very bad form).

And never use futur proche in the subordinate clause.,verbs

Unless she has her computer... she cannot work.,Sauf si elle a (indicatif présent) son ordinateur... elle ne peut (indicatif présent) pas travailler.; Generally the consequence (she cannot work) is negated when using an unless (sauf si) phrase (unless she has her computer).; This example illustrates 1 of 3 possible pairings in French when using sauf si: 1) Sauf si + indicatif présent... + indicatif présent 2) Sauf si + indicatif présent... + indicatif futur 3) Sauf si + indicatif imparfait... + conditionnel présent,verbs
Unless I am near a cat... I will not sneeze.,Sauf si je suis (indicatif présent) près d'un chat... je n'éternuerai pas (indicatif futur).; Generally the consequence (she cannot work) is negated when using an unless (sauf si) phrase (unless she has her computer).; This example illustrates 1 of 3 possible pairings in French when using sauf si: 1) Sauf si + indicatif présent... + indicatif présent 2) Sauf si + indicatif présent... + indicatif futur 3) Sauf si + indicatif imparfait... + conditionnel présent,verbs
I would not share my photos... unless I trusted the person.,Je ne partegerais pas (conditionnel présent) mes photos... sauf si je faisais (indicatif imparfait) confiance À la personne.; Generally the consequence (she cannot work) is negated when using an unless (sauf si) phrase (unless she has her computer).; This example illustrates 1 of 3 possible pairings in French when using sauf si: 1) Sauf si + indicatif présent... + indicatif présent 2) Sauf si + indicatif présent... + indicatif futur 3) Sauf si + indicatif imparfait... + conditionnel présent,verbs
I will walk... unless is rains. Use both SAUF SI and À MOINS QUE.,Je vais marcher... sauf s’il pleut (indicatif). + Je vais marcher... à moins qu’il pleuve (subjonctif).; Sauf si does not trigger subjonctif mood. À moins que does trigger subjonctif mood.,verbs

This is the best way to ask the question in formal and informal situations.; Rarely used ultra-formal alternative: Puis-je ('pweej')...? Je puis is a formal alternative to Je peux. It is literally just a different way to express 'I can'. But if you use inversion to ask a question then peux-je is impossible/forbidden. So one would have to use puis-je. But this is a very rare phrasing. Do not use this as a foreigner.,verbs
How do you ask politely: May I keep this? (e.g. a menu),Pourrais-je garder ça?; Use POUVOIR in the conditionnel présent tense to ask if you may do something.,verbs
How do you ask politely: Could you please open the door?,Pourriez-vous / Pourrais-tu ouvrir la porte?; Verb is POUVOIR. Use conditionnel mood to be polite.,verbs
How do you ask politely: Would you like some water?,Voudriez-vous / Voudrais-tu de l'eau?; Verb is VOULOIR. Use conditionnel mood to be polite.,verbs
What is the 'indicatif plus que parfait' (pluperfect) verb tense?,'Perfect' means 'completed' when talking about verb tenses. So use this tense to describe an event in the past that 'had taken' place and 'had been' completed BEFORE some other past event. Often the words AVANT or DÉJÀ are in the phrase. Generally another phrase using passé composé or imparfait must be present. The phrase in plus que parfait happens before.; Do not use this for something that happened independently or in the recent past (when you would use passè composé or imparfait instead).; In English we call this the 'past perfect' tense (e.g. I had been doing something).; In English we often use a simple past tense (e.g. passé composé or imparfait) for both events in the past. But in french you MUST use plus que parfait whenever you are describing an event that occurred before some other event (or context) in the past.,verbs
How do you construct the 'indicatif plus que parfait' verb tense?,Same as passé composé but AVOIR and ÊTRE auxiliaries are conjugated au imparfait. Use the same past participle as passé composé.; e.g. I had been eating BEFORE you saw me. = J'avais mangé (plus que parfait) AVANT tu me voyais (imparfait).,verbs
She returned to Portugal because her visa had expired.,Elle est rentrée (passé composé) au Portugal parce que son visa avait expiré (plus que parfait).; Use plus que parfait for a past event that occurred before some other past event.; Literally: Her visa had expired.,verbs
I read the book because I heard it was good.,J'ai lu le livre parce que j'aVais entendu (plus que parfait) que c'était bon.; The second phrase (j'avais entendu) is conjugated in the plus que parfait (literally: I had heard...) because it is a past event that occurs before some other past event.,verbs
Yesterday I was sick because I had eaten oysters.,Hier j'était (imparfait) malade parce que j'aVais mangé (plus que parfait) des huîtres.; Plus que parfait can be paired with passé composé or imparfait... as long as the plus que parfait phrase occured before the other phrase.,verbs
I had a horrible trip because I had forgotten my suitcases and I had gotten a headache.,J'ai passé (passé composé) un séjour horrible parce que j'avais oublié (plus que parfait) mes valises et j'avais eu (plus que parfait) mal à la tête.; The phrase conjugated in plus que parfait can describe a discrete action or the context - as long as that phrase occurred before another action/context in the past.,verbs
I missed my interview because my train was cancelled.,J'ai raté (passé composé) mon entretien d'embauche parce que mon train avait été (plus que parfait) annulé.; In this case there are two events in the past and they are sequential. Therefore the first event should use plus que parfait.,verbs
The train was cancelled. + The book was taken.,Le train a été annulé. + Le livre a été pris.; In a vacuum passé composé is appropriate for both of these.,verbs
I was late to class because I woke up too late.,J'étais en retard (imparfait) en classe parce que je m'étais réveillée (plus que parfait) trop tard.; The first event must be conjugated in plus que parfait (even if it is contextual instead of a discrete action). The second event can be imparfait or passé composé.,verbs
If I had found ten euros (then) I would have bought a coffee.,Si j’aVais trouvé (plus que parfait) dix euros... j'auRais acheté (conditionnel passé) un café.; If a conditional phrase (if..) is in the past (e.g. If we had arrived earlier...) - instead of in the present tense (e.g. If we arrive early...) - then that phrase should use the plus que parfait tense. And that means that the resultant/hypothetical phrase (what would have happened if the if-statement was true) should use the conditionnel passé tense (would have/could have/should have).,verbs
If they had found ten euros (then) they would have bought a coffee.,S'ils aVaient trouvé (plus que parfait) dix euros... ils auRaient acheté (conditionnel passé) un café.; Si contracts with any word that starts with a vowel.; NB: Never use IF in the same phrase as the conditionnel mood. That would be duplication because the conditionnel mood assumes a hypothetical.,verbs
We would have finished early if we had worked together.,On auRait fini (conditionnel passé) si on aVait travaillé (plus que parfait) ensemble.; If a conditional phrase is in the past (if we had worked together) then that phrase should use the plus que parfait tense. That means that the resultant/hypothetical phrase (we would have finished earlier) should use the conditionnel passé tense (would have/could have/should have).,verbs
What is the 'indicatif futur antérieur' verb tense?,It indicates an event in the future that happens before some other event. It's like the future version of plus que parfait. e.g. The box will have been delivered (futur antérieur) before the guests will arrive (futur simple).,verbs
How do you construct the 'indicatif futur antérieur' verb tense?,auxiliary être/avoir au futur simple + participe passé; e.g. Tu seras sorti. = You will have gone out (before some other action).,verbs
I will leave when they (all female) have finished.,Je sortirai quand‿elles‿auront fini ('kohn-Tehl-Zau-rohn-fih-nee').; auront fini is futur antérieur tense because it is an event that happens in the future but it happens before some other event in the future.; Remember that the D in quand sounds like a T when you make a liaison.,verbs
When robotics have penetrated all homes... we will not live in the same way.,Quand la robotique aura pénétré (futur antérior) dans toutes les maisons... nous ne vivrons (futur simple) plus de la même manière.; There are two events in the future and one comes before the other (or one depends on the other). So use futur antérior (for the first) and futur simple (for the second).,verbs
I will have finished when you arrive.,J'aurai fini (futur antérior) quand tu arrivera (futur simple).; There are two events in the future and one comes before the other (or one depends on the other). So use futur antérior (for the first) and futur simple (for the second).,verbs
If you come home late... I will have already crashed (gone to bed).,Si tu rentres (indicatif présent) tard... je serai déja couché (futur antérior).; This is an example of pairing indicatif présent with futur antérior. We can only do this when the phrase using indicatif présent actually occurs in the future - because we need two events that happen in sequence (or with causality) in the future.,verbs
The world will be better when all children have received an education.,Le monde ira (futur simple) mieux quand tous les enfants aura récévu un bonne education.; This is a typical construct for using futur antérior verb tense. One depends on the other so there is a squence of two events in the future. Use futur antérior (for the first) and futur simple (for the second).,verbs
It will be better when I find a job.,Ça ira (futur simple) mieux quand j'aurai trouvé (futur antérior) un emploi.; This is a typical construct for using futur antérior verb tense. One depends on the other so there is a sequence of two events in the future. Use futur antérior (for the first) and futur simple (for the second).,verbs
It will be better when I speak french more fluently.,Ça ira (futur simple) mieux quand j'aurai parlé plus couramment.; This is a typical construct for using futur antérior verb tense. One depends on the other so there is a sequence of two events in the future. Use futur antérior (for the first) and futur simple (for the second).,verbs
What are the three cases where it is required to use 'indicatif futur antérior' verb tense in French - where other languages (including English) do not use this or any perfect (completed) tense?,1) After conjonctives / conjonctive phrases. e.g. As soon as you HEAR it you must tell me. Conjugate HEAR in futur antérior (like 'have heard'). 2) When making an assumption about what happened in the past. e.g. I must have FORGOTTEN it. Conjugate FORGOTTEN in futur antérior (like 'have forgotten'). 3) Historical narratives. e.g. She PUBLISHED her first novel in 1962. Conjugate PUBLISHED in futur antérior (like 'have published').,verbs
As soon as you eat it... you must leave.,Dès que tu l'aurais mangé (futur antérior)... tu dois partir.; Following a conjonctives / conjonctives phrase is 1 of 3 cases (in French) where we are required to use futur antérior - even though it is likely not required in other languages.; A short list of conjonctives / conjonctive phrases: après que + dès que / aussitôt que + quand / lorsque + une fois que,verbs
I cannot find my bag... I must have left it in the car.,Je ne peux pas trouver mon sac... Je l'aurais laissé dans la voiture.; Assumptions about the past are 1 of 3 cases (in French) where we are required to use futur antérior - even though it is likely not required in other languages.,verbs
What are les temps composés?,Verb tenses that use an auxiliary. e.g. passé composé + plus que parfait + futur antérieur. If a verb tense is composed (has an auxiliary) in one mood then it will also be composed in another mood.,verbs
What is a verb mood in the french language?,'des modes des verbes' are the 7 large subgroups of verb conjugations. Within each mode there may be multiple tenses.; For example: Conditionnel is a mood that contains 2 tenses: conditionnel présent and conditionnel passé. Participe is a verb mood that contains 2 tenses: participe présent and participe passé.; 4 of the moods are 'personnel'. 3 of the moods are 'impersonnel'.,verbs
List the 4 'modes personnel' (personal verb moods). Explain when they are used.,1) Indicatif: expresses reality and certainty; 2) Conditionnel: expresses a hypothesis that is (implicitly or explicitly) dependent on something else happening; 3) Subjonctif: expresses a 'sub-reality' - something that the speaker knows may not necessarily reflect reality; 4) Impératif: expresses a command,verbs
List the 3 'modes impersonnel' (impersonal verb moods). Explain when they are used.,1) Infinitif: the nominal form of a verb - it can even be the subject of a phrase  2) Participe: used to form the second half of all composed tenses 3) Gérondif: modifies a verb by expressing simultaneous actions of the how/why of how something happened; These verb modes do not agree in gender/number with a subject because they are impersonnel.,verbs
What is the 'subjonctif' verb mood?,Transforming a verb into the subjonctif mood expresses that a phase does not necessarily reflect reality: doubt or impossibility or subjectivity (that it is subjective from the point of view of the speaker).; For example: I wish that you do not smoke. When saying this in French the verb(s) in the second half of the phrase (you do not smoke) would be conjugated in the subjonctif mood (not indicatif or conditionnel) because not smoking does not exist in reality - it is a wish in the thoughts of the speaker (subjectivity).; Sometimes the structure of a phrase makes conjugation in the subjonctif mood obligatory (previous example). Sometimes the use of the subjonctif is a choice of the speaker based on context (e.g. when the speaker wants to make it clear that the opinion they are expressing is subjective - not necessarily based in reality.),verbs
When is the 'subjonctif' verb mood used?,The more uncertainty that exists the more likely that the subjonctif is required - though it is not an exact science and sometimes a choice made by the speaker.; Some major categories (not exhaustive) obligate the subjonctif: 1) an obligation (or lack of obligation e.g. il ne faut pas que...) 2) a feeling / sentiment (Je suis heureuse que... + Je suis surpris(e)/choqué(e) que...) 3) judgement /appreciation (C'est bien que...) 4) a wish (Je veux/voudrais que...) 5) a possibility or doubt (C'est possible que... + J'ai doute que...) 6) when the speaker wants to insinuate that something may not be as it appears,verbs
What is the English equivalent of the 'subjonctif' verb mode?,This mode does not exist (with direct translation) in English which is very important to keep in mind. In french the subjonctif mood is used to show that a statement is subjective - perhaps not fully based in reality.; If this subtlety is not taken into account in a translation (e.g. if one does not pick up on whether the indicatif or subjonctif was used) then the intention will be misunderstood.,verbs
Translate the following to use a) indicatif mood and b) subjonctif mood. Explain how the meaning changes. I am happy that you are happy.,Indicatif: Je suis content(e) que tu es content(e). = I'm happy that you are a happy and I really believe that you are happy.; Subjonctif: Je suis content(e) que tu sois content(e). = I am happy that you are happy - but are you really happy?...I think that you might not be.; This is an example of a non-obligatory use of the subjonctif mood. The speaker chooses the subjonctif mood to throw doubt on the statement in the 2nd case.,verbs
How do you construct the 'subjonctif présent' verb tense?,For the nous/vous forms: Use the radical from nous/vous au présent. Add imparfait endings. (e.g. venir -&gt venions + veniez); For je/tu/il/ils forms: 1) Use the radical from the ILS form au présent. Add the présent endings (e.g. venir -&gt ils viennent -&gt vienn).; So for most verbs the subjonctif sounds like the ils/elles forms in indicatif présent.,verbs
How do you construct the 'subjonctif passé' verb tense?,For passé composé: Conjugate the auxiliary (avoir or être) in subjonctif mood. Then add the participe passé as you would in passé composé.; For imparfait: Use the subjonctif base and add the subjonctif imparfait endings: je: asse + tu: asses + il: ât + nous: assions + vous: assiez + ils: assent,verbs
How do you construct the 'subjonctif futur' verb tense?,This does not exist. When you use the subjonctif you are acknowledging that the statement is virtual (may not reflect reality) and that means for right now or any time in the future. So if you have a phrase in a future tense and you need to use the subjonctif mood... then simply use subjonctif présent.; This is how it works in English too. e.g. I wish that you did not smoke (now or in the future - this part is implicit).,verbs
What are the requirements of using the subjonctif mood?,Three requirements: 1) A subjonctive phrase is dependent on another phrase triggering the subjonctive tense. e.g. I wish that you have a good life. 'I wish' is indicatif présent but the verb 'to wish' triggers the subjonctive mood in the subsequent dependent phrase: that you have a good life.; 2) A subjonctive phrase always starts with the word 'que' or 'qui'. e.g. Je souhaite... QUE vous ayez (avoir in subjonctive) une belle vie.; 3) The independent phrase (that triggers the subsequent subjonctif) must have a subject that is different from the subject in the subjonctif phrase. e.g. I wish that I have a good life. You can't use the subjonctif in this case because the subject of both phrases is the same.,verbs
How do you differentiate between verbs that trigger the subjonctif vs those that do not?,The level of certainty (or proximity to reality) and emotion determines whether or not to use the subjonctif. Statements without emotion and expressing a high level of certainty (e.g. I am sure that... + It is evident that... + It is very probably that...) do NOT trigger the subjonctif. Simple opinions and observations do NOT trigger subjonctif because they are not emotional and the statements are fairly certain - what a person thinks is actually what they think. The following do NOT trigger the subjonctif: Je pense que... + Je crois que... + Je trouve que... + J'espère que... + J'ai l'impression que... ; However when you negate these statements then they indicate uncertainty/doubts. So then they DO trigger subjonctif: Je NE pense PAS que... + Je NE crois PAS que... + Je NE trouve PAS que... + Je N'espère PAS que... + J'ai doute que...; The presence of emotions makes the subordinate clause more uncertain/subjective (potentially further from reality). So the following trigger the subjonctif: J'ai peur que... + Je suis outré(e) que...,verbs
Which of these trigger the subjonctif: J'aimerais que... vs J'espère que...,J'aimerais que... (I would like that...) triggers the subjonctif because it is a wish and the dependent phrase probably differs a lot from the current reality. J'espère que... (I hope that...) is somewhat of an exception. It does not trigger the subjonctif unless it is negated.,verbs
Which of these trigger the subjonctif: C'est bien que... vs Il semble que...,C'est bien que... (It's good that...) triggers the subjonctif because it is a personal judgement. Il semble que... (It seems that...) does not trigger the subjonctif. It is a straightforward remark/observation.; NB: C'est evident que... does not trigger subjonctif because it is also a remark/observation and it indicates certainty.,verbs
Which of these trigger the subjonctif: C'est possible que... vs C'est probable que... vs C'est peu probable que...,C'est possible que... triggers subjonctif because there is lack of certainty.; C'est probable que... does NOT trigger subjonctif because there is enough certainty in the phrase that follows - it is probable.; C'est peu probable que... does trigger the subjonctif because there is a fair amount of uncertainty in the statement that follows - it's not probable.,verbs
Which of these trigger the subjonctif: Je suis desolé(e) que... vs Je demande que...,Both trigger the subjonctif. Je suis désolé(e) que (I'm sorry that) is a sentiment. Je demande que (I order that) is an order/demand.,verbs
Conjugate parler (regular in indicatif) in the subjonctif présent.,que je parle ('shhhhhparl') + que tu parles + qu'il/elle/on parle + que nous parlions + que vous parliez + qu'ils/elles parlent (-ent is silent for all verbs); PARLER is regular in indicatif présent AND au présent subjonctif.,verbs
Conjugate finir (regular in indicatif) in the subjonctif présent.,que je finisse + que tu finisses + qu'il/elle/on finisse + que nous finissions + que vous finissiez + qu'ils/elles finissent (-ent is silent for all verbs); FINIR is regular in indicatif présent AND au présent subjonctif.,verbs
Conjugate venir (irregular in indicatif) in the subjonctif présent.,que je vienne + que tu viennes + qu'il/elle/on vienne + que nous venions + que vous veniez + qu'ils/elles viennent (-ent is silent for all verbs); VENIR is irregular in indicatif présent but it is completely regular in subjonctif présent.,verbs
Conjugate prendre (irregular in indicatif) in the subjonctif présent.,que je prenne + que tu prennes + qu'il/elle/on prenne + que nous prenions + que vous preniez + qu'ils/elles prennent (-ent is silent for all verbs); PRENDRE is irregular in indicatif présent but it is completely regular in subjonctif présent.,verbs
Conjugate être in subjonctif présent. It is completely irregular in subjonctif.,Pronounced 'SWA': que je sois ('swa') + que tu sois + qu'il/elle/on soit + que nous soyons + que vous soyez + qu'ils/elles soient (-ent is silent for all verbs),verbs
Conjugate avoir in subjonctif présent. It is completely irregular in subjonctif.,nous/vous forms are the only times we hear the 'Y'. Otherwise just pronounce the hard A ('ay'): que j'aie + que tu aies + qu'il/elle/on ait + que nous ayons (add Y sound) + que vous ayez (add Y sound) + qu'ils/elles aient (-ent is silent for all verbs),verbs
Conjugate aller in subjonctif présent. It is completely irregular in subjonctif.,nous/vous forms are the only times we hear the 'L'. Otherwise just pronounce the hard I ('eye'): que j'aille + que tu ailles + qu'il/elle/on aille + que nous allions (add L sound) + que vous alliez (add L sound) + qu'ils/elles aillent (-ent is silent for all verbs),verbs
Conjugate faire in subjonctif présent. It is completely irregular in subjonctif.,que je fasse + que tu fasses + qu'il/elle/on fasse + que nous fassions + que vous fassiez + qu'ils/elles fassent (-ent is silent for all verbs),verbs
Conjugate pouvoir in subjonctif présent. It is completely irregular in subjonctif.,que je puisse + que tu puisses + qu'il/elle/on puisse + que nous puissions + que vous puissiez + qu'ils/elles puissent (-ent is silent for all verbs),verbs
It is possible that you will never return.,C'est possible que tu ne reviennes jamais.; C'est possible que triggers the subjonctif because there is enough uncertainty in the dependent phrase. But if you had said 'It is probable that...' then there is too much certainty to use the subjonctif.; REVENIR is the infinitive.; JAMAIS replaces PAS.,verbs
I'm not certain that he remembers it.,Je ne suis pas certaine qu'il s'en souvienne.; The expression of uncertainty triggers the subjonctif in the second phrase. SOUVENIR is conjugated exactly like VENIR - but remember that it is reflexive.,verbs
I am convinced that...,Je suis convaincue que...; This does not trigger the subjonctif because it indicates a high level of certainty in whatever phrase follows.,verbs
It is required that the president listen to the citizens.,Il faut que le président ecoute les citoyens.,verbs
It is not required that we do the homework.,Il ne faut pas qu'on fasse les devoirs.; Obligations - even when negated - (e.g. It's necessary/essential/required that...) trigger the subjonctif.,verbs

It is fundamental that we test our code.,Il est fondamental qu'on teste notre code.; Obligations (e.g. It's necessary/essential/required that...) trigger the subjonctif.,verbs
I like that you swim. + I like that I swim.,J'aime que tu nages (subjonctif). + J'aime nager (infinitive).; In the second phrase we replace the subjonctif phrase with an infinitive because the subjects of the two phrases are the same. In order to use the subjonctif the subjects of the two phrases must be different.,verbs
I prefer (indicatif présent) that you go to the park (présent subjonctif).,Je préfère que tu ailles (subjonctif) au parc.; NB: préférer has a slight variation (change accent aigu to accent grave) au présent in all but the nous and vous forms.; The expression of a preference (I prefer) triggers the subjonctif in the phrase (that you go to the park).; ALLER is irregular in subjonctif.,verbs
I would prefer (conditionnel présent) that you go to the park (présent subjonctif).,Je préférerais que tu ailles (subjonctif) au parc.; NB: The change of accent in conjugation of préférer is only applicable in indicatif présent so no change to the accent in this case (conditionnel présent).; Statements in both the indicatif and conditionnel moods can trigger the subjonctif in the second phrase.; ALLER is irregular in subjonctif.,verbs
My preference is X.,Ma préférence est X.,vocabulary
She wants the meal to be ready by 8 o'clock.,Elle veut que la repa soit (ÊTRE au subjonctif) prête pour huit heures.; VOULOIR triggers the subjonctive. And we can use the subjonctive because the subjects of the two phrases (she and the meal) are different.,verbs
She wants to please everyone.,Elle veut faire plaisir à tout le monde.; 'She wants...' would trigger the subjonctive. But we can't use that because the subject of the two phrases (she and she) are the same. So just use the inifinitive to express the desire.,verbs
How do you use the subjonctif for something in the past (e.g. I wished that you told me.)?,Use passé composé. Conjugate the auxiliary in the subjonctif. The past participle stays the same.; When you use the subjonctif mood in the past tense you must use passé composé. You cannot use imparfait.,verbs
How do you use the subjonctif for something in the future (e.g. It's necessary that you take the bus tomorrow.)?,There is no subjonctif futur tense. So use subjonctif présent.; Il faut que tu prennes (subjonctif present) le bus demain.,verbs
I must cry.,Il fait que je pleure (subjonctif).; This is by far the most common way of expressing that you must do something (not with devoir and not with avoir besoin).; The literal translation of 'il fait' is 'it is required'. Obligations trigger the subjonctif in the subsequent phrase (e.g. Il fait que + SUBJONCTIF phrase).,verbs
I hope that the sky is blue.,J'espère que le ciel est (indicatif présent) bleu.; ESPÉRER (to hope) does NOT trigger the subjonctif mood. It is an exception to the subjonctif rules. So we use indicatif présent instead here.,verbs
They hope that you will eat well.,Ils/Elles espèrent que tu mangeras (indicatif futur simple) bien.; ESPÉRER  (to hope) does NOT trigger the subjonctif mood. It is an exception to the subjonctif rules. So we use indicatif futur simple instead here.,verbs

I do not believe that you have a dog.,Je ne crois pas que tu aies (AVOIR au présent subjonctif) un chien.; CROIRE does not trigger the subjonctif when it is used in the positive sense. But it does trigger the subjonctif mood when it is negated.,verbs
I have doubt about a word.,J'ai doubt SUR un mot.,verbs

What do you want me to do?,Qu'est-ce que vous voulez que ça me fasses (subjonctif présent)?; The subjonctif mood is triggered because the affirmative version would be: You want that I (do something).,verbs
What is the common way to express: X is required. / X is necessary.; What is the infinitive of the verb?,Il faut...; FALLOIR is the infinitive. The meaning is similar to DEVOIR but FALLOIR is only ever conjugated for 3rd person singular (il/elle/on). FALLOIR communicates that some ambiguous 'it' or 'one' must be or do something.,verbs
idiomatic way to express: It is a must-have.,C'est incontournable.; incontournable = unavoidable,vocabulary
One must be determined to work here.,Il faut être déterminé(e) pour travailler ici.; IL FAUT + ÊTRE + any adjective is a good way to express: One must be X...; This is using the pattern: Il faut + INFINITIVE which avoids the subjonctif.,verbs
It is important that the muscles are warm before stretching.,C'est IMPORTANT QUE les muscles soient (subjonctif) chauds avant les étirements.; Any kind of opinion like this (e.g. It is critical that...) triggers the subjonctif.,verbs
What are four progressively direct/confrontational ways to say: You must go to the doctor.,Using FALLOIR is always the least confrontational. 1) The softest possible is IL FAUT + INFINITIV: Il faut aller chez médecin.; 2) The next stronger option is IL FAUT QUE + SUBJONCTIF PHRASE: Il faut QUE tu ailles (subjonctif) chez le médecin.; 3) Phrases stronger than the previous two do not us FALLOIR: e.g. Il est nécessaire que...; 4) The most confrontational phrases use DEVOIR: Tu doit aller chez le médecin.,verbs
What are two generalized / non-aggressive ways to say: You/One must take the medicine.,Using FALLOIR is always the least confrontational. 1) least direct: Il faut prendre le médicament. 2) more direct: Il faut QUE vous preniez (subjonctif) le médicament.; The latter is slightly more targeted/personal and with a higher sense of urgency.; Both are much less harsh than using DEVOIR: Vous devez prendre le médicament.,verbs
What are two generalized / non-aggressive ways to say: We must win this match.,Using FALLOIR is always the least confrontational. 1) least direct: Il faut gagner ce match. 2) more direct: Il faut QU'on gagne (subjonctif) ce match.; The latter is slightly more targeted/personal and with a higher sense of urgency.; Both are much less harsh than using DEVOIR: On doit gagner ce match.,verbs
What is a very direct / confrontational way to say: You must eat healthily.,Using DEVOIR is always the most confrontational: Vous devez manger sainement.; This is much more direct than: Il faut manager sainement. or Il faut que vous manger sainement.,verbs
Using FALLOIR what are two ways to say: You/One must rest.,1) Il faut SE reposer. (more generalized / less aggressive); 2) Il faut TE/VOUS reposer. (still generalized but slightly more personalized / confrontational and with higher sense of urgency); SE REPOSER is reflexive. This means that there is an additional layer of subtlety that can be used simply by changing whether or not the reflexive pronoun is conjugated.; Both options are less confrontational than using Il faut que...,verbs
I must wait.,Il faut que j'attende.; It is more common to express this using FALLOIR (instead of using DEVOIR).; Il faut que triggers the subjonctif so j'attende is in the subjonctif form.,verbs
You had to do your homework before going out.,More targeted with high sense of urgency: Il fallait (FALLOIR in imparfait) que tu fasses (subjonctif) tes devoirs avant de sortir.; More generalized alternative: Il fallait faire tes devoirs avant de sortir. This translates more to 'it was required to do our/your homework...'; FALLOIR alone signifies a general requirement. FALLOIR + QUE is a very targeted and personal statement.,verbs

We took the train before he ate lunch. + We took the train before eating lunch.,Nous avons pris le train AVANT QU'il ne déjeune (subjonctif). + Nous avons pris le train AVANT DE déjeuner (DE + infinitive).; The first phrase triggers subjonctif because of the use of AVANT QUE and because the two subjects are different.

What is the difference between a gerund and a present participle in English?,They are spelled exactly the same: verb base + ING (e.g. giving + waiting + swimming). In english gerunds act as nouns (e.g. I enjoy swimming.) Swimming is the direct object in this sentence. In english present participles act as adjectives (e.g. the waiting person + an interesting film) or verb tenses (e.g. I was waiting.).,verbs
What is the difference between 'gérondif' and 'participe' in French?,Gérondif and Participe are both verb moods. They each contain two tenses: présent + passé.; The participe présent is the base of nous-form (indicatif présent) + ANT (e.g. vivre -&gt vivons -&gt vivant).; In french... When used alone (without 'en') the participe présent modifies a noun by explaining what the noun is doing or the reason why something is happening. e.g. We saw Jean eating. = On a vu Jean mangeant. Here eating modifies the nearest noun (Jean).; The gérondif présent is formed by EN + participe présent (e.g. en mangeant). Gérondif présent modifies a verb. e.g. We saw him while eating. = On l'a vu EN mangeant. Here eating is an additional action taken by we.; Generally the gérondif is used when speaking and the participe présent is only used in writing (often for literary effect) - it sounds odd when spoken. e.g. Regardant la lune... = Looking at the moon...,verbs
What is the difference between gerunds in English and gérondif in French?,In english the definition of a gerund is a verb acting as a noun. e.g. I like swimming. Swimming is an english gerund acting as a noun. It is the direct object (a noun) of the verb.; But in french neither 'gérondif présent' nor 'participe présent' can act as a noun. e.g. I like swimming. = J'aime nager. In french we use the infinitive mood (instead of gérondif or participe moods) to talk about a verb as a noun.,verbs
What are the participes présents for these verbs: choisir + sortir?,choisir: choisissant + sortir: sortant; Choisir is a regular -IR verb. Indicatif présent: nous choisissons.

Having the need for money... I look for a job.,Ayant (partipe présent) besoin d'argent... Je cherche un emploi. OR Nécissant d'argent... ; You can think of participe mood verbs as replacing QUI (when they describe what a thing is doing) or COMME/CAR/PARCE QUE (when they describe the cause of something). In this case it replaces PARCE QUE (parce que j'ai besoin d'argent),verbs
The post being interesting... I read it completely.,Le poste étant (participe présent) intéressant... je l'ai lu complètement.; You can think of participe mood verbs as replacing QUI (when they describe what a thing is doing) or COMME/CAR/PARCE QUE (when they describe the cause of something).

I finished on time by waking up at 6h.,J'ai fini à temps EN ME réveillant à 6h.; Use a gérondif présent (en + participe présent) because SE RÉVEILLANT modifies the main verb (FINIR) - revealing why or how the main verb happens.; If using a reflexive verb as gérondif then the reflexive pronoun must agree with the subject (je).,verbs
While finishing... + While thinking deeply / reflecting...,En finissant... + En réfléchissant...; Use gérondif (en + participe présent) to describe concurrent activities.; FINIR and RÉFLÉCHIR are regular group 2 -IR verbs. These verbs have SS in the base of their participes présent - same as their conjugations in indicatif présent.,verbs
While going out... + While leaving...,En sortant... + En partant...; Use gérondif (en + participe présent) to describe concurrent activities.; SORTIR and PARTIR are not group 2 -IR verbs (despite ending in -ir). So these verbs do not have SS in the base of their participes présent - same as their conjugations in indicatif présent.,verbs
What is the 'la voix passive' (passive voice)?,This is not a verb tense. It is a way to indicate that something is being done to a subject (le sujet passif) by an agent (le sujet actif) - to emphasize the object instead of the subject. e.g. The chicken is followed by her chicks. It emphasizes a direct object (the chicken) over the real subject/agent (the chicks). If we used active voice instead: The chicks follow the chicken.; In passive voice the agent can always be omitted: The chicken is followed.; Passive voice can only be used with verbs that have a direct object.,verbs
How do you construct a phrase in 'la voix passive' (passive voice)?,subject/object + ÊTRE conjugated + participe passé + PAR + the agent; The participe passé must agree in gender and number with the subject of the passive sentence (le sujet passif).; The agent can be completely omitted. e.g. La vaisselle est faitE (par Henri). = The dishes are done by Henry. The participe passé must be feminine (faite instead of fait) to agree with la vaisselle.; NB: If the verb describes a feeling or opinion then use DE (instead of PAR) before the agent.,verbs
How do you adapt 'la voix passive' (passive voice) to the past and the future?,Change the conjugation of être to the desired tense. Any tense is possible. e.g. The pie is made by Derrek. = La tarte est (indicatif présent) faite par Derrek.  The pie was made. = La tarte a été faite (passé composé). The pie was being made. = La tarte était (indicatif imparfait) faite.; The participe passé must be feminine (faite instead of fait) to agree with la tarte.,verbs

Which verbs cannot be used in 'la voix passive'?,AVOIR plus verbs that do not have a direct object (because la voix passive requires that the sujet passiv be a direct object of the verb).; This means that the following verbs cannot be used in la voix passive: AVOIR + Intransitive Verbs (verbs that do not have objects),verbs
Which verbs use 'la voix passive' even though there is no direct object?,décéder and mourir (both mean to die),verbs
The book is written by the team.,Le livre est écrit par l'équipe.; This is the indicatif présent tense in the passive voice. écrit (participe passé) can stay masculine singular because the subject (le livre) is masculine singular.; Use PAR before the agent (l'équipe) because the verb is not expressing opinion/feeling.,verbs
The comic strip is written by the team.,La bande dessinée est écritE par l'équipe.; This is the indicatif présent tense in the passive voice. écritE (participe passé) must be made feminine because the subject (la bande) is feminine singular.; Use PAR before the agent (l'équipe) because the verb is not expressing opinion/feeling.,verbs
The professor is hated by his colleagues.,Le professeur est détesté DE ses collègues.; This is the indicatif présent tense in the passive voice. détesté (participe passé) can stay masculine singular because the subject (le professeur) is masculine singular.; Use DE (instead of PAR) before the agent because the verb is expressing opinion/feeling.,verbs
The decision is appreciated by everyone.,La décision est très appréciéE DE tout le monde.; This is the indicatif présent tense in the passive voice. appréciéE (participe passé) must be made feminine because the subject (la décision) is feminine singular.; Use DE (instead of PAR) before the agent because the verb is expressing opinion/feeling.,verbs
My mother woke me up. + I was woken up by my mother.,Ma mère m'a révaillé. + J'ai été réveillé(e) par ma mère.; When a reflexive verb is placed in la voix passive... it is no longer reflexive.,verbs
The subject is talked about by all the newspapers.,This phrase (as is - using talked about in the passive voice) cannot be translated to French because we can only use la voix passive with direct objects in French. The active voice version of this phrase has an indirect object: Tous les journaux parlent DU sujet. (parler de X = to talk about X).; If we want to la voix passive then we have to change the phrase so that the object is a direct object: Le sujet est évoqué dans tous les journaux. = The subject is mentioned in all of the newspapers.,verbs
She was defended by the lawyer.,Elle a éte défendue par l'avocat(e).; This is passive voice in passé composé. So we use the voix passive pattern and conjugate être in passé composé.; The participe passé (défendue(e)) must agree with the sujet passif (elle).,verbs
She was being defended by the lawyer.,Elle était défendue par l'avocat(e).; This is passive voice in imparfait. So we use the voix passive pattern and conjugate être in imparfait.; The participe passé (défendue(e)) must agree with the sujet passif (elle).,verbs
She will be defended by the lawyer.,Elle sera défendue par l'avocat(e).; This is passive voice in futur simple. So we use the voix passive pattern and conjugate être in futur simple.; The participe passé (défendue(e)) must agree with the sujet passif (elle).,verbs
I wish that she is defended by the lawyer.,Je souhaite qu'elle soit défendue par l'avocat(e).; This passive voice in subjonctif. So we use the voix passive pattern and conjugate être in subjontif.; The participe passé (défendu(e)) must agree with the sujet passif (elle).,verbs
Transform this phrase into la voix passive: Je suis sorti au cinema.,This phrase cannot be transformed into passive voice because the verb does not have a direct object. A direct object is required to form le sujet passif.; The clue is that SORTIR is using être as an auxiliary in this case. That means that the verb describes state of being (instead of action). We cannot use passive voice with verbs that use être as auxiliary.,verbs
Transform this phrase into la voix passive: J'ai sorti le chien au parc.,Le chien a été sorti par moi.; This phrase can be tranformed into passive voice because the verb does have a direct object (le chien). A direct object is required to form le sujet passif.; The clue is that SORTIR is using avoir as an auxiliary in this case. That means that the verb describes action (often with a direct object to receive the action).,verbs
Transform these phrases into la voix passive: I write to my father. + I write the letter.,The first phrase cannot be transformed to la voix passive because there is no direct object. The second phrase does have a direct object so we can transform it: Le lettre est écrit par moi.,verbs
Bothered by the noise` she decided to move.,DérangéE (agrees with elle) par le bruit` elle a décidé de se déplacer.; The first clause is passive voice with a participe passé that is completely lacking an auxiliary.

She became French.,Elle est naturalisée française.; NATIONALISER = to become a citizen,vocabulary
What is 'passé simple' verb tense?,This is completely interchangeable with passé composé (same use cases). Passé simple (now) is only used in written texts of fiction or history - often the history of famous people and events with an especially grand character.; In old French passé composé was only used for verbal communication - never written. The language has evolved to use passé composé in both writing and speaking.,verbs
How do you construct 'passé simple' verb tense?,RADICAL + endings: je -ai + tu -as + il/elle/on -a + nous -âmes + vous -âtes + ils/elles -èrent,verbs
What is indirect speech and how does it impact verb conjugation?,Indirect/reported speech happens when we do not use direct quotes to reference something that was said. Direct speech: She said 'The car is (présent) blue'. Indirect speech: She said that the car was (imparfait) blue.; Notice that the tense of the verb of the spoken portion changed.; This change occurs in English and French. Whether a change is required depends on the verb tense of the introducteur (she said...). If - for example - the introducteur was au présent (she says...) then there would be no transformation of the spoken portion.,verbs
What is the most common case of reported speech that triggers a transformation of a verb?,In indirect/reported speech... when the introducteur is in passé composé then we must transform the verb in the dependent clause. e.g. direct speech: He told me 'The cat is (présent) black'. indirect speech: He told me that the cat was (imparfait) black.; The introducteur (he told me) is in passé composé. This means that we always have to transform the verb in the spoken portion. The tense to which we transform depends on the original tense of the spoken portion. In this case the original verb is au présent so it transforms to imparfait.,verbs
Which tenses do not get transformed when moving from direct speech to indirect speech?,conditionnel mood + subjonctif mood + indicatif imparfait + plus que parfait; If the introductuer is au présent or au futur then you are not obligated to change the tense when reported indirectly.; Generally the imparfait does not need to be transformed but there are some cases where it changes to plus que parfait.,verbs
If information is originally in passé composé and then reported indirectly... which tense is used?,passé composé transforms into plus que parfait; Original: She said 'He ate it.' = Elle a dit 'Il l'a mangé (passé composé). Indirect: She said that he had eaten it. = Elle a dit QU'il l'avait mangé (plus que parfait).,verbs
If information is originally in futur simple and then reported indirectly... which tense is used?,futur simple transforms into conditionnel présent; Original: She said 'He will eat it.' Indirect: She said that he would eat it.,verbs
If information is originally in futur antérior and then reported indirectly... which tense is used?,futur antérior transforms into conditionnel passé; Original: She said 'He will have eaten it.' Indirect: She said that he would have eaten it.,verbs
If information is originally in impératif and then reported indirectly... which tense is used?,impératif transforms into DE + INFINITIVE; Original: She ordered 'Eat the apple.' = Elle a ordonné 'Mangez la pomme (impératif).' Indirect: She ordered that the apple be eaten. = Elle a ordonné DE manger (infinitive) la pomme.,verbs
If information is originally in indicatif présent and then reported indirectly... which tense is used?,It depends. 1) If introductuer is also in présent: Keep the verb in présent.  2) If introducteur is in a past tense: transform into imparfait.  3) If the subject of both clauses is the same: Use DE + INFINITIVE (though this is optional - not required).,verbs
If information is originally in futur proche and then reported indirectly... which tense is used?,This depends only on the tense of the verb ALLER. e.g. She said 'He is going to eat.' = Elle a dit 'Il va manger'.

What is an independent possessive pronoun?,An independent possessive pronoun is a shortcut for showing ownership where the pronoun stands on its own instead of being an adjective to the noun that is possessed. For example: This is my cat. 'my' is a possessive pronoun. 'cat' is the noun being possessed (by me). BUT... This cat is mine. 'mine' is the independent possessive pronoun - you could eliminate the cat entirely: It is mine.,pronouns
How do you construct the independent possessive pronouns in french? (e.g. mine),There are two ways to express these in french. In both cases you need a second word. 1) DEFINITE ARTICLE + non-generic posessive pronoun: e.g. C'est mien. = It's mine. ...if the noun (that is owned) is singular/masculine. Both the article and the possessive pronoun change to adapt to the gender and number of the noun being owned. 2) À + generic pronom tonique: e.g. La chat est à moi. = The cat is mine. These pronouns do not adapt to the number and gender of the possessed noun.,pronouns

What are all the forms (masc sing + fem sing + masc pl + masc pl) of the possessive pronouns that mean 'ours'?,LE nôtre + LA nôtre + LES nôtres (m/f plural); NB: For nous + vous + ils/elles forms the plural possessive pronoun is the same regardless of the gender of the thing that is owned.; Do not forget the definite article.

Do adjectives come before or after the noun they describe?,Generally adjectives follow the noun that they describe. But there are many exceptions. Some categories of adjectives are always placed before the noun. For example: Salutations like Bonne week-end! Bonne nuit. For example: Adjectives that indicate order/class (premier/première + dernier/dernière + etc) are placed before the noun they describe.; It is also true that some adjectives can be used on either side of the noun and the placement changes the meaning.,vocabulary
Which adjectives almost always come before the noun they are describing (instead of after it as expected)?,autre + long + court + jeune + nouveau + vieux/vieille + petit(e) + grand(e) + gros(se) + joli(e) + mal/mauvais + beau/belle/beaux (beautiful; m/f/pl) + bon/bonne/bons/bonnes (good) + meilleur/meilleure/meilleurs/meilleures (better) + le meilleur/ la meilleure/ les meilleurs/ les meilleures (best); NB: When adjectives are used to indicate order/class (premier/première + dernier/dernière + etc) then they are also placed before the noun they describe.; NB: The masculine singular versions of these adjectives may change spelling if the noun begins with a vowel or silent H.,vocabulary
What changes when an adjective is placed before a noun instead of after it (as is the general case)?,When an adjective is placed before a noun then the spelling of that noun becomes important. If the noun starts with a vowel then it may change the spelling of the adjective. This is most common for adjectives that end in -eau and -eux. For example: The masculine singular version of 'old' is vieux. But an old man = un vieil (not vieux) homme because H is treated as a vowel.,vocabulary
When an adjective can be placed either before a noun or after a noun - what does the placement indicate?,There are many adjectives that change meaning completely depending on whether they are placed before or after the noun. But for the other adjectives that are generally always placed after a noun (e.g. magnifique) then the placement before the noun indicates a more emphathetic or subjective value. e.g. un paysage magnifique vs un magnifique paysage. The second example is more empathetic/subjective.,vocabulary
List 3 categories of adjectives that are placed before the noun.,l'esthétique (une belle femme) + la taille (un grand écran) + un chiffre/l'âge (J'ai deux ans.),vocabulary
List 3 categories of adjectives that are placed after the noun.,la nationalité (la femme française) + la couleur (les yeux blue) + functionality (un écran étanche = a waterproof screen),vocabulary
What is the general rule for adapting adjectives to gender and number?,Add E to form feminine singular - this will force the pronunciation of the final consonant (that was silent in the masculine singular form) but it's a light touch on the consonant...it's not hard or heavy; Add S to form masculine plural; Add ES to form feminine plural; No change in pronunciation from the singular to plural forms of the same gender because the S and ES are generally silent.; There are many different variations of adjectives but this is the most basic transformation.,pronunciation
When do adjectives have the same spelling and pronunciation for masculine and feminine and plural?,Generally any adjective that ends in an E or S or X in the masculine form is spelled the same in the feminine form.,vocabulary

dead,décédé(e) is the preferred way to express this.; You can also use mort(e) which is the adjective form of the verb mourir. When the E is added in the feminine form it forces the pronunciation of the final consonant of the male version but it is quick and short.,vocabulary

She is close to death.,Elle est sur la point de mourir. OR Elle pourrait décédée bientôt.; Use décéde(e) - as opposed to mort(e) - whenever possible.,vocabulary

Specify the pronunciation.,masc sing: vieux ('vyuh') + fem sing: vieille ('vee-yay') + masc pl: vieux ('vyuh'; same as masc sing) + fem pl: vieilles ('vee-yay'; same pronunciation as fem sing); NB: If a masculine noun starts with a vowel or silent H then the adjective changes from vieux ('vyuh') to vieil ('vee-ay'; same pronuncation as the feminine forms).,vocabulary

Which adjectives (that are placed before a noun) change their form when the noun starts with a vowel?,This only happens three times to adjectives in the masculine singular! 1) beau changes to bel: un bel amour (not un beau amour)   2) vieux changes to vieil: un vieil ami (not un vieux ami)   3) nouveau changes to nouvel: un nouvel ordinateur (not un nouveau ordinateur); This avoids an adjective ending in a vowel followed by noun beginning with a vowel.,vocabulary
new,nouveau (masculine singular) / nouvelle (feminine singular) / nouveaux (masculine plural) / nouvelles (feminine plural); Adjectives that end in EAU in the singular form add an X to make the plural form.; Nouveau/nouvelle is one of the adjectives that comes before the noun it modifies. This leads to a change in spelling. If the noun is masculine singular and begins with a vowel then use nouvel (instead of nouveau). e.g. un nouvel appartement.,vocabulary
the new objects; Specify pronunciation.,les nouveaux‿objets ('lay-znoo-voh-Zohb-szhay'); There is a liaison between nouveaux and objets.,vocabulary
What is a way to express 'new' that is not nouveau/nouvelle?,neuf (masculine singular) / neuve (feminine singular) / neuves (feminine plural); NB: neuf/neuve are placed after the noun like a regular adjective.

the new shoes,des nouvelles chaussures; Alternative: des chaussures neuves new shoes. This uses neuf/neuve which is placed after the noun like a regular adjective.,vocabulary

varied,divers(e) OR varié(e); Diverse is a faux ami. It does not refer to diversity of backgrounds in french.; Varié(e) can be used to mean different/varied. It cannot be used to me 'many' in french.,vocabulary
the diversity,la diversité; e.g. la diversité des commerces = the diversity of businesses (in a city),vocabulary
curious (odd or different),curieux/curieuse (m/f); Placement changes the meaning of the adjective. It means strange/bizarre if placed before the noun. It means nosy/overly inquisitive/indiscreet if placed after the noun.; If you mean curious in the positive sense (e.g. interested to learn) then you have to add more to the sentence to explain that.,vocabulary
curious (inquisative),This does not translate directly because the adjective curieux/curieuse has a negative connotation when used alone (before or after the noun). To express curiousity in a positive way you must add more context: Je suis curieux/euse DE SAVOIR comment faire quelque chose. OR Je suis curieux/euse DE CONNAÎTRE quelque chose.,vocabulary
I am curious about the shoes.,Je suis curieux/curieuse DE CONNAÎTRE les chaussures.; Curious has a negative connotation when translated directly.

What are the two major rules (not exhaustive) for transforming an adjective to an adverb (e.g. blind to blindly)?,1) If the masculine adjective ends in vowel (e.g. vrai + absolu + probable): Add -MENT (e.g. vraiment).; 2) If masculine adjectives ends in consonant (e.g. amical + heureux + long): Select the feminine adjective and add -MENT (e.g. amicalement + heureusement + longuement).; These 2 rules ensure that adverbs have a vowel immediately preceding the -MENT ending. Sometimes (no rule of thumb) we add an accent to that E (e.g. obscur = obscure; obscurÉment = obscurely).; NB: Adverbs do not change form to agree with gender/number because they modify verbs - not nouns.,vocabulary
How do you transform an adjective that ends in -ANT or -ENT to an adverb?,Replace -ant with -AMMENT. Replace -ent with -EMMENT.; e.g. apparENT becomes apparEMMENT; NB: This is a group of exceptions from the general two rules for transforming adjectives to adverbs.,vocabulary
absolute + absolutely,absolu (same m/f) + absolument; To form the adverb when the masculine adjective ends in a vowel... just add -MENT.,vocabulary
probable + probably,probable (same m/f) + probablement; To form the adverb when the masculine adjective ends in a vowel... just add -MENT.,vocabulary
idiomatic way to express: for sure / definitely,forcément; NB: forcément is a common expression and it is a faux ami. It means something like 'for sure' or 'certainly' or 'with strong probability'. It does not mean 'with lots of force'.; It can be used in a way that is close to 'strongly' like this: Il forcément ressemble à son père. = He strongly (or certainly) resembles his father.,vocabulary
apparently,apparemment,vocabulary
normal + normally,normal(e) + normalement; To form the adverb when the masculine adjective ends in a consonant... Use the feminine form of the adjective and add -MENT.,vocabulary

uniform + uniformly,uniforme + uniformément; This is a slightly irregular adverb because we add accent É.,vocabulary
precise + precisely,précis(e) + précisément; This is a slightly irregular adverb because we add accent É.,vocabulary
convenient + conveniently,pratique is the best adjective to use for convenient. But there is an alternative: commode. And the adverb that means conveniently is: commodément.; This is a slightly irregular adverb because we add accent É.,vocabulary
deep + deeply,profond(e) + profondément; This is a slightly irregular adverb because we add accent É.; fonder = to base something / to have a basis for taking action; soutenu(e) = deep only when we are talking about a color,vocabulary
Explain the meaning of 'le fond'.,Literally this just means 'the bottom' or 'the base'. But it is more commonly used to mean the context / substance / significance of something.

approfundi,in-depth / heavy / deep analysis; This is a way to describe good journalism.,vocabulary
intense + intensely,intense + intensément; This is a slightly irregular adverb because we add accent É.,vocabulary

brief + briefly,bref/brève (m/f) + brièvement (Two vowel sounds in first syllable! 'bree-ehv-uh-mohn'); This is an irregular adjective/adverb pairing. It does not follow the major rules for transforming and adjective to an adverb.,vocabulary
to express,exprimer (s'exprimer is to express oneself),verbs
to describe + to imply,décrire,verbs
to tell (a story),raconter (une histoire / un récit / un conte); pronounced 'ra-kohn-Tay' - 'ra' is like the word 'rad' without the D or the word 'racoon'. The first syllable is NOT 'ray'.; There is only one N and the T is really sharp because it is not followed directly by an R. So the pronunciation is very different from the verb rencontrer (to meet for the first time); Raconter is used much more commonly than dire (to say) when you are talking about something that was told.,verbs
to imply,impliquer; NB: impliquer can have different meanings. Il est impliqué. = He is engaged in the discussion.,verbs

What is the difference between se plaindre and râler?,They both mean 'to complain'. SE PLAINDRE is the proper verb and is more dignified. plaignant(e) = someone who has stated or submitted a formal complaint (perhaps 'plaintiff' in english).; RÂLER is a more casual and derogatory verb that can mean 'to moan/groan' (think someone saying 'rahrahrah'). râleur/râleuse = the grumpy person or the person who protests perhaps in an illogical way,vocabulary
the plaintiff (the one who submits/raises a complaint) + the person who protests (potentially illogically),plaignant(e) from SE PLAINDRE + râleur/râleuse (m/f) from RÂLER,vocabulary
I can't complain.,Je ne peux pas me plaindre.; SE PLAINDRE = to complain,verbs
There is always something to complain about.,Il y a toujours quelque chose à redire.; This is an idiomatic way to say 'something to complain about' = quelque chose à redire,vocabulary

debbie downer,rabat-joie,vocabulary
basic/mediocre + extraordinary/original,banal(e) + pas banal(e); Use the same word to express both. In english 'not banal' is neutral but in french it means the opposite of banal.; If instead of mediocre you mean introductory (e.g. basic courses) then use basique or commun(e).,vocabulary
unique,original(e) OR exceptionnel(le); Alternative: insolite but this can mean unusual.; Unique is a faux ami. In French unique/uniquement means 'only'. e.g. une fille unique = an only daughter. But you could say: unique au monde to mean that something is exceptional.,vocabulary
eccentric,If you are describing a thing: atypique. If you are describing a person: excentrique.,vocabulary
despised + looked down upon,méprisé(e) + C'est mal vu.,vocabulary
common + uncommon,commun(e) + pas commun(e); There is not a different word for uncommon.; Pronounced 'kom-UHN'. The emphasis is on the last syllable and it sounds like un/une (the number 1 fem/masc) and the first syllable of ingénieur(e). This is different from the word comment which is pronounced 'ko-moe'.,vocabulary
relevant,pertinent(e) is the most common way to express this.; Alternatives: approprié(e) = appropriate OR  être en rapport avec quelque chose = to be relevant to something,vocabulary
It's not relevant.,Ça n’a aucun rapport.; être en rapport avec quelque chose = to be relevant to something; Alternative: Ça n'est pas pertinent(e).,conversation
It's unrelated.,C'est rien à voir.; This roughly translates to: It's nothing to do with it.,conversation
lazy,Three adjectives: 1) paresseux/parasseuse = lazy + the lazy person + slow + sluggish; 2) fainéant(e) = lazy + idle + idler; 3) feignant(e) = lazy; NB: Adjectives ending in EUX ('oo') in the masculine form change to EUSE ('ose') in the feminine form.,vocabulary
the laziness / idleness,la paresse / la fainéantise,vocabulary
selfish / self-centered,égoïste (same for m/f); Watch out because égoïste only means selfish. If you mean egotistical then use arrogant(e).; autocentré(e) is the literal translation for self-centered but I've only heard it used to reference the french language which uses (and repeats) personal pronouns more than English.,vocabulary
arrogant,arrogant(e) OR hautain(e); NB: égoïste = selfish (not egotistical),vocabulary
idiomatic way to express that someone is a know-it-all,Il/Elle a la science infuse.; Use AVOIR. This is used sarcastically or with negative connotation. The literal translation is to have innate knowledge - to know everything without having to learn it first.; If you negate it then the connotation is neutral: Je n'ai pas la science infuse. = I'm not an expert.,vocabulary

expected,attendu(e); C'était attendu. = It was expected.,vocabulary
unexpected + unexpected beyond your wildest dreams,inattendu(e) ('ee-nah-tuhn-deww') + inespéré(e); The I in both sounds like 'ee'. Not like 'ingénieure'.; Inattendu(e) and étonnant are much more idiomatic than the literal translation of 'surpising' in French.; insoupçonné(e) = inattendu(e),vocabulary

Where do you place pronouns (that are objects of the verb) in indicatif imparfait and conditionnel présent?,If there is only one word representing the verb in imparfait then pronouns come before that verb; NB: This is true for all tenses where a single word represents the entire verb.,pronouns
Where do you place pronouns (that are objects of the verb) in indicatif futur proche?,in between the conjugated form of ALLER and the INFINITIVE; NB: This follows the rule of dual verbs. Whenever you need two different verbs in french where one is a conjugated HELPER and the other is the INFINITIVE (e.g. I want to dance = Je veux danser)... then pronouns usually are placed before the infinitive - but not before the helper verb.,pronouns
Where do you place pronouns (that are objects of the verb) in indicatif futur simple?,If there is only one word representing the verb in futur simple then pronouns come before that verb; NB: This is true for all tenses where a single word represents the entire verb.,pronouns
List the french pronoms sujets (aka subject pronouns) e.g. YOU went to the store.,je + tu + il/elle/on + nous + vous + ils/elles,pronouns
What is a COD (compléments d’objet direct) aka a direct object?, An object that receives or experiences the action of the verb. It answers the question: What? e.g. You bought what? I bought it (COD).; COD (direct objects) generally follow a verb when spelled out. If we use a COD pronoun then the pronoun moves in front of the verb.,pronouns
List the french COD pronoms.,me + te + le(m)/la(f) + nous + vous + les(m/f); me + te + le/la change to m’ + t’ + l’ in front of a vowel or mute H.; NB: The COD pronouns for he/she/they are the same as the definite articles (le/la/l'/les).,pronouns
What is a COI (compléments d’objet indirect) aka an indirect object?,An indirect object receives a direct object or is 'for whom' the action of the verb is done. It answers the question: to whom? e.g. You gave the book to whom? I gave the book to them (COI).; Indirect objects are placed before a verb as pronouns but follow the verb when spelled out explicitly.; NB: English is slightly different than French. When a preposition is used in front of the object in English (for THEM) then it is technically NOT an indirect object. Instead we call it an 'object of a preposition'. e.g. I gave the book to THEM. The coffee is for HIM.,pronouns
List the french COI pronoms.,me + te + lui(m/f) + nous + vous + leur(m/f); me + te change to m' and t' in front of a vowel of mute H.; NB: The COI pronouns for him/her/them are genderless. LUI is used for both masculine and feminine.; NB: LEUR does not have an S when used as a COI pronom. But leur can also be a possesive adjective (e.g. their cat = leur chat). When leur is used as a possesive adjective then it must agree with the number of the noun that it describes (e.g. their cats = leurs chats).,pronouns
Sometimes we do not use a COI pronom to reference an indirect object or object of a preposition. When is that the case?,Use COI unless it is one of the many special cases where pronoms toniques is used instead. This depends - among other things - on the preposition (or lack thereof) required by the verb - which is not consistent between English and French (cannot be translated directly).; NB: In English the treatment of pronouns for indirect objects and objects of a preposition are the same. The pronouns taking the objective case: him/her/them.,pronouns
Which COD and COI pronouns are the same? Which are different?,They are mostly the same: me + te + nous + vous. The only perspectives in which they differ are 3rd person singular (le/la vs lui) and 3rd person plural (les vs leur).,pronouns
When we have both a COD pronom and a COI pronom in a sentence they are both placed before the verb. Which one is placed first?,COI; General order: Subject + COI pronom + COD pronom + Verb.; Exception: When both pronouns are in the 3rd person then the order is reversed.; In spoken french it is very uncommon that both a COD and a COI pronoun are used. Typically a person will only use one pronoun and be explicit about the other object.,pronouns
Do these verbs trigger a COD pronom or a COI pronom? aimer + appeler + écouter + lire + voir,They trigger a COD pronom. e.g. Je vois Audrey. = I see Audrey. Je LA (not lui) vois. = I see her.; e.g. J'écoute Audrey = I listen to Audrey. Je l'écoute. = I listen to her.,pronouns
Do these verts trigger a COD pronom or a COI pronom? parler + plaire + répondre + téléphoner,They trigger a COI pronom. e.g. Je réponds Audrey = I respond to Audrey. Je LUI (not la) réponds. = I respond to her.,pronouns
You want me to 'do something'.,Tu veux que je... ; VOULOIR triggers the subjonctif to express this (You want that I...). We do not translate it directly with a direct or indirect object (me).,pronouns
If some noun/pronoun is an indirect object in English then will it also be an indirect object in French? Why?,No. Not necessarily.; French and English verbs differ in their use of prepositions. This means that a verb might use a preposition in English but not in French (and vice versa). The presence/absence of a preposition can often determine whether or not the object of the verb is direct or indirect. So you have to memorize whether how each french verbs us prepositions in order to know which pronouns to use for the objects following the verb.,pronouns
We listen to our mothers. + We listen to THEM.; Explain the selection of the french pronoun for 'them' in this case.,Nous écoutons nos mères. + Nous LES (COD) écoutons.; In English the verb that means 'to listen to something' requires a preposition TO and its object is indirect. But in french the verb ÉCOUTER does not use a preposition and its object is direct (not indirect). So when we replace the object (mothers) with a pronoun we use COD (les) instead of COI (leur).,pronouns
We call our mothers. + We call THEM.; Explain the selection of the french pronoun for 'them' in this case.,Nous téléphonons À nos mères. + Nous LEUR (COI) téléphonons.; In English the verb that means 'to call someone' does not require a preposition and its object is direct. But in french the verb TÉLÉPHONER requires the preposition À and its object is indirect (not direct). So when we replace the object (mothers) with a pronoun we use COI (leur) instead of COD (les).,pronouns
Define transitive and intransitive verbs. Give examples.,Transitive verbs have direct object (and therefore can have indirect objects as well). e.g. To put: He put the book on the table.; Intransitive verbs do not have direct (or indirect) objects. e.g. To die: John died last year. e.g. Il fait beau.; Intransitive verbs include: reflexive verbs + verbs that describe the state of the subject (often verbs that use être as auxiliary) + verbs that do not have an object that receives an action (e.g. dormir + voyager + pleurer).,pronouns
Can verbs be both transitive and intransive?,Yes. It depends on how they are used. 1) TENIR as transitive verb with COD: Il tient sa tête. 2) TENIR as transitive verb with COI: Il tient à sa femme. 3) TENIR as intransitive verb: Il tient toute la journée.,pronouns
What is are 'verbes attributifs'? Do they have direct/indirect objects?,Verbes attributifs are a subset of intransitive verbs (which have neither direct or indirect objects). Verbes attributifs (être is commonly used in this way) describe the state of the subject (not an action). They link to an 'attribut du sujet' which is an adjective phrase that describes the subject.; e.g. Simone is a leader. = Simone est dirigeante. etre = un verbe attributif. dirigeante = un attribut du sujet.; Examples of verbs that can be used as verbes attributifs: être + sembler + devenir + avoir l'air de qqch,pronouns
Which part of this sentence is the 'verbe attributif' and the 'attribut du sujet'? La voiture est rouge.,être = verbe attributif (in this case). rouge = attribut du sujet (in this case).;A verb can only be called a 'verbe attributif' when it is being used to describe the state of the subject AND when it links to an attribut du sujet. If the verb is followed by a CC (instead of attribut du sujet) then it is not a verbe attributif.,pronouns
What is a CC (complément circonstanciel)?,A CC (complément circonstanciel) is a word or phrase that explains the context of the action of a verb (e.g. when + where + how). It adds precision related to the verb (not an object).; CCs can exist in addition to CODs and COIs. e.g. Je mange une pomme (COD) aujourd'hui (CC).; But CCs are often found in use with intransitive verbs (that do not have CODs or COIs). e.g. She rested calmly in the room. = Elle se reposait tranquillement (CC) dans la pièce (CC). There is no COD or COI. The CCs give us contextual information relevant to the verb.,pronouns
Which parts of these sentences are CCs (complément circonstanciel)? 1) Je l'ai vu dans le théâtre. 2) Je l'y ai vu.,1) dans le théâtre is the CC because it describes where exactly the verb happens. 2) Pronom Y is the CC for the same reason as the first phrase.,pronouns
What are the requirements for when a verb must agree (in number/gender) with the object (instead of the subject) of a phrase?,Requirements: 1) The verb is using avoir (not être) as its auxiliary. 2) The object is a direct (not indirect) object. 3) The direct object (could be a noun or a pronoun) precedes the verb. 4) The direct object is associated with a conjugated part of the verb (e.g. the past participle) so that the verb can be adapted - not a supplementary verb that is in the infinitive form (because we can not change an infinitive to agree in gender/number). 5) The verb is not related to perception (e.g. voir + entendre),pronouns
I am buying the car that you recommended.,J'achete la voiture que tu as recommandéE (singular feminine agreement).; The past participle of the verb must adapt to the object (la voiture) because this example satisfies all of the requirements for when a verb must agree in gender/number with a direct object (instead of the subject).,pronouns
I found them (my glasses) under the couch.,Je les (plural feminine COD) ai trouvéES (plural feminine agreement) sous le canapé.; The past participle of the verb must adapt to the object (them - the glasses) because this example satisfies all of the requirements for when a verb must agree in gender/number with a direct object (instead of the subject).,pronouns
He gave them (the books) to me.,Il me les (plural masculine COD) a donnéS (plural masculine agreement).; The past participle of the verb must adapt to the object (them - the glasses) because this example satisfies all of the requirements for when a verb must agree in gender/number with a direct object (instead of the subject).,pronouns
Here are the photos that I took during vacation.,Voici les photos que j'ai prisES (feminine plural agreement) pendant les vacances.; The past participle of the verb must adapt to the object (the photos) because this example satisfies all of the requirements for when a verb must agree in gender/number with a direct object (instead of the subject).,pronouns
The gifts were given by me. + I gave them (the gifts) to you.,Les cadeaux étaient offertS (masculine plural agreement) par moi. + Je te les ai offertS (masculine plural agreement).; The first sentence uses passive voice. It demonstrates how we sometimes adapt verbs (offrir) to agree with an object (the gifts).; The second sentence is passé composé but the past participle must adapt to the object (the gifts) because this example satisfies all of the requirements for when a verb must agree in gender/number with a direct object (instead of the subject).,pronouns
Here’s the dress that I thought about buying.,Voici la robe que j’ai pensé (no agreement with direct object) acheter.; PENSER does not agree with the direct object (la robe) because PENSER is related more closely to the subject (je). The object (la robe) is more closely related to the verb in the infinitive form (acheter) in this case. We cannot change infinitives to agree with nouns.,pronouns
A song that I heard... + A song that I played...,Une chanson que j'ai entendu (no agreement with direct object)... + Une chanson que j'ai jouéE (singular feminine agreement with chanson).; ENTENDU does not agree with the direct object that comes before the noun because this is an edge case where the verb is a perception (e.g. voir + entendre),pronouns
A subject that I heard about...,Un sujet DONT j'ai entendu parler; DONT (instead of que) because entendre parler triggers DE.,pronouns
The house that you saw... + The house that you bought...,La maison que tu as vu (no agreement with direct object)... + La maison que tu as achetéE (singular feminine agreement with chanson).; VU does not agree with the direct object that comes before the noun because this is an edge case where the verb is a perception (e.g. voir + entendre),pronouns
She advised Marie to buy a house. + She advised her of it (to buy a house).,Elle a conseillé à Marie d'acheter une maison. + Elle le lui a conseillé.; The COI is à Marie. The COD is d'acheter une maison. Those verb phrases can be represented by COD pronoms.; to advise = CONSEILLER quelque chose à quelqu'un,pronouns
What is the difference between 'une consultation' and 'une concertation'?,une consultation: when you meet with someone in order to receive advice. You may or may not take action.; une concertation: a meeting of multiple people with the purpose of making a decision.,vocabulary
What are pronoms toniques?,Pronouns that always represent people (not things) and are used in specific situations. For example: 1) for emphasis when putting an element in relief (mettre en relief)  2) to show possession 3) to replace COI depending on the prepositions in play; Other names for these pronouns: stressed pronouns + disjunctive pronouns + pronoms disjunct,pronouns
List the pronoms toniques.,moi + toi + lui(m)/elle(f) + nous + vous + eux(m)/elles(f); me + te change to m' and t' in front of a vowel of mute H.; NB: Pronoms toniques differ by gender in 3rd person singular AND plural. (This is not surprising considering that pronoms toniques are always used to refer to people - never to things.); For example... 'to him/her/them(m)/them(f)' does not adapt to gender because TO triggers COI: lui/lui/leur/leur. BUT 'with him/her/them(m)/them(f)' must adapt to gender because WITH triggers tonique (assuming that we are referencing people): avec lui/elle/eux/elles.,pronouns
What are the special scenarios where we use pronoms toniques?,Most importantly you can only use a pronom tonique when referencing a person (not a thing). Then the scenarios include (but are not limited to): 1) a short response to question (e.g. Who is there? I am! = Moi!); 2) when an element is put in relief for emphasis (a very french structure).  e.g. Me` I am... = Moi` je suis...; 3) indirect objects when we are forced - in french - to place a preposition (like APRÈS AVEC DANS DEVANT POUR SANS CHEZ...) in front of the pronoun; 4) in comparisons after QUE - remember that QUE contracts to QU' when followed by a vowel (e.g. bigger than her = plus grand qu'elle; bigger than them masculine = plus grand qu'eux); 5) a shortcut for ownership called independent possessive pronouns (e.g. mine = à moi); 6) together with -même (e.g. moi-même = myself + elle-même = herself + lui-même = himself),pronouns
Are pronoms toniques placed before or after the verb?,Generally all pronouns (including pronoms toniques) are placed before the verb. But there is an exception with pronoms toniques. If there is direct interaction between subject and object then place the pronoun before the verb. e.g. Je lui/elle parle. = I talk to him/her. If there is no direct interaction between the subject and object then we keep the preposition and pronoms toniques are placed AFTER the verb. e.g. Je pense à lui/elle = I think about him/her.,pronouns
for me + you + him/her + us + you guys + them(m/f),POUR triggers pronoms toniques (as long as the pronouns reference a person): pour moi + toi + lui/elle + nous + vous + eux/elles,pronouns
with me + you + him/her + us + you guys + them(m/f),AVEC triggers pronoms toniques (as long as the pronoun references a person): avec moi + toi + lui/elle + nous + vous + eux/elles,pronouns
his + hers + theirs(m) + theirs(f),à lui + elle + eux + elles; Use pronoms toniques to show ownership when the owner is a person. It also requires preposition À in french.,pronouns
I walk the dog (gender not specified).,Je promène le chein.; PROMENER does not use a preposition for its direct object (the dog).; Objects of the verb (direct and indirect) are placed after the verb (unless they are represented by pronouns).,pronouns
I walk it (the male dog). + I walk it (the female dog).,Je LE promène. + Je LA promène.; The dogs are direct objects of the verb. So we use the COD (le/la) pronouns.; All pronouns that represent objects of the verb are placed before the verb.,pronouns
I help her/him. + I can help her/him.,Je L'aide. + Je peux l'aider.; AIDER does not use a preposition for its direct object (him/her). So we use the COD (le/la) pronouns.; Use l' to avoid two vowels together.; All pronouns that represent objects of the verb are placed before the verb.,pronouns
I bring you (informal). + I bring you (formal). + I bring us.,Je T'amène. + Je VOUS amène. + Je nous amène.; AMENER does not use a preposition for its direct object (you/us). So we use the COD (te/vous/nous) pronouns - though the COI pronouns in these cases are exactly the same.; All pronouns that represent objects of the verb are placed before the verb.,pronouns
I bring them (all masculine). + I bring them (all feminine).,Je LES améne. (same for both); AMENER does not use a preposition for its direct object (them). So we use the COD (les) pronouns.; All pronouns that represent objects of the verb are placed before the verb.,pronouns
She gives the hen to Anna. + She gives IT to ME.,Elle donne la poule À Anna. + Elle ME LE donne.; DONNER does not use a preposition of its direct object (the cat). DONNER uses À for its indirect object (Anna).; All pronouns come before the verb. If a phrase includes both COD and COI pronouns then the COI pronoun comes first. UNLESS both pronouns are in the 3rd person - then the order is reversed.,pronouns
She gives IT (feminine) to you (informal).,Elle TE LA donne.; 'It' is a COD (la). 'You' is a COI (te) because DONNER uses À before its indirect object.; All pronouns come before the verb. If a phrase includes both COD and COI pronouns then the COI pronoun comes first. UNLESS both pronouns are in the 3rd person - then the order is reversed.,pronouns
She gives IT (feminine) to him/her.,Elle LA LUI donne.; 'It' is a COD (la). 'Him/her' is a COI (lui) because DONNER uses À before its indirect object.; All pronouns come before the verb. If a phrase includes both COD and COI pronouns then the COI pronoun comes first. UNLESS both pronouns are in the 3rd person - then the order is reversed.,pronouns
She gives IT (feminine) to us.,Elle NOUS LA donne.; 'It' is a COD (la). 'Us' is a COI (nous) because DONNER uses À before its indirect object.; All pronouns come before the verb. If a phrase includes both COD and COI pronouns then the COI pronoun comes first. UNLESS both pronouns are in the 3rd person - then the order is reversed.,pronouns
She gives IT (feminine) to you (formal).,Elle VOUS LA donne.; 'It' is a COD (la). 'You' is a COI (vous) because DONNER uses À before its indirect object.; All pronouns come before the verb. If a phrase includes both COD and COI pronouns then the COI pronoun comes first. UNLESS both pronouns are in the 3rd person - then the order is reversed.,pronouns
She gives IT (feminine) to them (m/f).,Elle LA LEUR ('leuhr' same as heures) donne.; 'It' is a COD (la). 'Them' is a COI (leur) because DONNER uses À before its indirect object.; All pronouns come before the verb. If a phrase includes both COD and COI pronouns then the COI pronoun comes first. UNLESS both pronouns are in the 3rd person - then the order is reversed.,pronouns
We work for me. + We work for you (informal).,Nous travaillons pour MOI. + Nous travaillons pour TOI.; The preposition pour triggers pronoms toniques as long as the pronoun references a person.,pronouns
We work for him. + We work for her.,Nous travaillons pour LUI. + Nous travaillons pour ELLE.; The preposition pour triggers pronoms toniques (which disambiguate between genders in 3rd person) as long as the pronoun references a person.,pronouns
We work for us. + We work for you (formal).,Nous travaillons pour NOUS. + Nous travaillons pour VOUS.; The preposition pour triggers pronoms toniques as long as the pronoun references a person.,pronouns
We work for them (masculine) + We work for them (feminine).,Nous travaillons pour EUX ('oo'). + Nous travaillons pour ELLES.; The preposition pour triggers pronoms toniques (which disambiguate between genders in 3rd person) as long as the pronoun references a person.,pronouns
We go without them (unspecified gender).,On va sans EUX.; The preposition sans triggers pronoms toniques so the object of the preposition (them without specified gender) translates to EUX (instead of les or leur). is the pronom tonique for them (male).,pronouns
It is difficult for them (all women) to travel.,C'est difficile pour ELLES de voyager.; The preposition pour triggers pronoms toniques so the object of the preposition (them feminine) translates to ELLES (instead of les or leur).,pronouns
Simone is stronger than her.,Simone est plus forte qu'ELLE.; Using the comparator QUE triggers pronoms toniques. So we use ELLE to represent 'her' (instead of la or lui).,pronouns
Michael and I are playing tennis.,Michel et MOI    jouons au tennis.; Use pronoms toniques (moi instead of je) whenever there are 2+ subjects of a sentence (and any of them are pronouns).; NB: One way to think of this: Michael WITH me. AVEC triggers the use of the pronoms toniques.,pronouns
He and I are friends.,LUI et MOI sommes amis.; Use pronoms toniques (lui instead of il) whenever there are 2+ subjects of a sentence (and any of them are pronouns).; NB: When the subject is compound (lui et moi) you should pause between the subject and verb. Running them together is not idiomatic.; As in English always put the pronoun of others before yourself (lui et moi... not moi et lui),pronouns
He and his friends are there.,Lui et ses amis   sont là.; Use pronoms toniques (lui instead of il) whenever there are 2+ subjects of a sentence (and any of them are pronouns).; NB: When the subject is compound (lui et ses amis) you should pause between the subject and verb. Running them together is not idiomatic.,pronouns
Them and their friends are there.,Eux et leurs amis   sont là.; Use pronoms toniques (eux instead of ils) whenever there are 2+ subjects of a sentence (and any of them are pronouns).; NB: When the subject is compound (eux et leurs amis) you should pause between the subject and verb. Running them together is not idiomatic.,pronouns
Who is going to the beach? He is! She is!,Qui va à la plage? Lui! Elle!; When answering a question quickly in french like this it triggers the pronoms toniques which disambiguate between gender in the 3rd person. So use lui/elle (disambiguated) instead of le/la or lui (ambiguous).,pronouns
They (unspecified gender) want to come too.,EUX aussi veulent venir.; When using emphatic phrases (words like aussi + non plus + seul) it triggers the pronoms toniques (eux - or elle - instead of les or leur).,pronouns
She is taller than you (are).,Elle est plus grande que toi.; The S in plus is not pronounced in this case because it precedes a word that starts with a consonant.; When making a comparison in french (e.g. following 'que') it triggers the pronom tonique (m'/moi + t'/toi + lui (m) + elle (f) + nous + vous + eux (m) + elles (f)),pronouns
I think about it. + I think about her.,J'y pense. + Je pense À ELLE (after the verb instead of before it!).; The first phrase uses Y because the object is a thing. We need a pronom tonique for the second phrase because the object is a person. In the second phrase the pronom tonique keeps a preposition and is placed after the verb (instead of before it). This is an example of the pronom tonique exception: If the subject and object are not interacting directly then keep the preposition (à) and place the pronom tonique after the verb. If the pronoun is not tonique then this rule does not apply.,pronouns
Have you thought about the cost? + Have you thought about it?,Est-ce que vous pensiez (imparfait) au coût ? + Est-ce que vous y pensiez ?; It seems that imparfait is a more common tense to use for thinking about something in the past.; penser à qqch... so use pronom Y to replace the object,pronouns
I dream of it. + I dream of him.,J'en reve. + Je rêve DE LUI (after the verb instead of before it!).; The first phrase uses EN becuase the object is a thing. We need a pronom tonique for the second phrase because the object is a person. In the second phrase the pronom tonique keeps a preposition and is placed after the verb (instead of before it). This is an example of the pronom tonique exception: If the subject and object are not interacting directly then keep the preposition (de) and place the pronom tonique after the verb. If the pronoun is not tonique then this rule does not apply.; NB: RÊVER can use both À and DE prepositions but the placement of pronouns is the same. e.g. J'y rêve. = I dream about it. + Je rêve à lui. = I dream about him.,pronouns
I ask her. + I pay attention to her.,Je elle demande. + Je fais attention À ELLE (after the verb instead of before it!).; The first phrase places the pronom tonique before the verb (per usual). In the second phrase the pronom tonique keeps a preposition and is placed after the verb (instead of before it). This is an example of the pronom tonique exception: If the subject and object are not interacting directly (the verb determines this) then keep the preposition (à) and place the pronom tonique after the verb. If the pronoun is not tonique then this rule does not apply.,pronouns
I phone him. + I get used to him.,Je lui téléphone. + Je m'habitue À LUI. (after the verb instead of before it!).; The first phrase places the pronom tonique before the verb (per usual). In the second phrase the pronom tonique keeps a preposition and is placed after the verb (instead of before it). This is an example of the pronom tonique exception: If the subject and object are not interacting directly (the verb determines this) then keep the preposition (à) and place the pronom tonique after the verb. If the pronoun is not tonique then this rule does not apply.,pronouns
He is going to do it himself.,Il va le faire lui-méme.; This is a special case that triggers pronom tonique.,pronouns
Everyone has to do it himself/herself.,Tout le monde doit le faire soi-méme.; Soi is used as a pronom tonique for unspecified persons. It is equivalent to 'one' or 'oneself' in English.,pronouns
I have to write it myself (without using AI).,Je dois l'écrire par moi-même (sans utiliser l'intelligence artificielle).; moi-même = on my own / by myself,pronouns
Everyone is going home.,On va chez soi.; Soi is used as a pronom tonique for unspecified persons. It is equivalent to 'one' or 'oneself' in English.,pronouns
Explain putting an element in relief (mettre en relief).,This a very common french structure where repetition (usually placed at the beginning or end of a phrase) is used to emphasize something. The repetition of the element can be in many different forms. Some common forms: the noun itself (the antecedent when its pronoun is used in the main phrase) + a pronom tonique (to repeat a subject that is a person) + a demonstrative pronoun (ça/cela to repeat a COD or a verb or a proposal),pronouns
I (emphasized; meaning not others) did it.,Je l’ai fait` moi.; Use la mise en relief with a pronom tonique to emphasize.; In this case the subject (JE) is a person and is already stated. Adding MOI (la reprise) at the end gives the impression of: I - and no one else - did it.,pronouns
I like him (emphasized; meaning not others).,Je l'aime` lui.; Use la mise en relief with a pronom tonique to emphasize.; In this case the object (LUI represented by L') is a person and is already stated. Adding another LUI (la reprise) at the end gives the impression of: I like him - and no one else.,pronouns
She came here. + It's she (emphasized) who came here.,Elle est venue ici. + C'est ELLE qui est venue ici.; Use la mise en relief to emphasize. In this case we do it with: C'est + pronom tonique.,pronouns
She wrote the letters. + The letters` she wrote them.,Elle a écrit LES lettres. + Les lettres` elle LES a écrit.; Use LES (as article and COD pronom) for definitive elements. The second phrase uses repetition (la mise en relief) for emphasis.,pronouns
She wrote some letters. + Some letters` she wrote some.,Elle a écrit DES lettres. + Des lettres` elle EN a écrit.; Use article DES and pronom EN for indefinite quantities. The second phrase uses repetition (la mise en relief) for emphasis.,pronouns
Singing` I adore it. + The soup` I detest it.,Chanter` j’adore ça. + La soupe` je déteste ça.; Use la mise en relief to emphasize. Demonstrative pronouns (ça/cela) can be used to replace verbs (chanter) and nouns (la soupe) and entire proposals.,pronouns
Traveling in France` it interests me. + Learning French` it is not easy.,Voyager en France` cela m'intéresse. + Apprendre le français` cela n'est pas facile.; Use la mise en relief to emphasize. Demonstrative pronouns (ça/cela) can be used to replace verbs and nouns and entire proposals (traveling in France + learning French).,pronouns
Which parts of speech do these relative pronouns reference/replace: QUI + QUE + DONT + À QUOI?,QUI: replaces a subject (which is why it is always followed by a verb); QUE: replaces a direct object of the verb (which is why it is followed by subject + verb); DONT: replaces an object of a verb that triggers DE (e.g. se souvenir de); À QUOI: replaces an indirect object of a verb that triggers À,pronouns
How do you use relative pronouns (qui + que + dont + à quoi) to emphasize a noun (mettre en relief)?,To mettre en relief: Create a new dependent clause. That clause will start with C'EST CE + the relative pronoun. QUI becomes C'est ce qui... QUE becomes C'est ce que... DONT becomes C'est ce dont... À QUOI becomes C'est à quoi...; Example without mise en relief: J'ai mangé le gâteau au chocolat. Example with mise en relief: Le gâteau au chocolat` c'est CE QUE j'ai mangé. Use CE QUE (instead of other relative pronouns) because 1) Gâteau is the object of the verb manger. and 2) There is no preposition required between manger and gâteau.,pronouns
The desire to improve my French is what made me choose France. (Use a relative pronoun to place 'desire...' en relief.),La volonté d'améliorer mon français` c'est CE QUI m'a fait choisir la France.; The desire is the subject. So to pull it into a dependent clause (for emphasis)... use c'est CE QUI (followed by verb).; C'EST can be placed in either the dependent or the independent clause: CE QUI m'a fait choisir la France` c'est la volonté d'améliorer mon français.,pronouns
The ability to speak French fluently` that is what I want. (Use a relative pronoun to place 'ability...' en relief.),La capacité de parler couramment le français` c'est CE QUE je voudrais.; The ability is the object (of je voudrais). So to pull it into a dependent clause (for emphasis)... use c'est CE QUE (followed by phrase).; C'EST can be placed in either the dependent or the independent clause: CE QUE je voudrais` c'est la capacité de parler couramment le français.,pronouns
Having a coffee on the terrace` that is what I adore. (Use a relative pronoun to place 'having...' en relief.),Prendre un café à la terrace` c'est CE QUE j'adore.; prendre un café is a verb. But it is also - in this case - the object (of j'adore). So to pull it into a dependent clause (for emphasis... use c'est CE QUE (followed by phrase).; C'EST can be placed in either the dependent or the independent clause: CE QUE j'adore` c'est prendre un café à la terrace.,pronouns
The rain` that is what I remember when we are in Paris. (Use a relative pronoun to place 'rain'en relief.),La pluie` c'est CE DONT je me souviens quand nous sommes à Paris.; The rain is the object of a verb that uses DE (se souvenir). So to pull it into a dependent clause (for emphasis)... use c'est CE DONT (followed by phrase).; C'EST can be placed in either the dependent or the independent clause: CE DONT je me souviens quand nous sommes à Paris` c'est la pluie.,pronouns
Tranquility` that is what I think about when I am in Paris. (Use a relative pronoun to place 'tranquility' en relief.),La tranquillité` c'est À QUOI je pense quand je suis à Paris.; The tranquility is the indirect object of a verb that uses À (penser). So to pull it into a dependent clause (for emphasis)... use c'est À QUOI (followed by phrase).; C'EST can be placed in either the dependent or the independent clause: À QUOI je pense quand je suis à Paris` c'est la tranquillité.,pronouns
The clubs` those are what I think about when I'm in Berlin. (Use a relative pronoun to place 'clubs' en relief.),Les clubs` ce SONT À QUOI je pense quand je suis à Berlin.; Remember that the verb in the independant clause must agree with the subject that is 'put on relief' in the dependent clause.,pronouns
What is an adverbial pronoun?,It is a pronoun that represents a place or a quantity or the object of a preposition.; 1) there: I go to the store. I go there. There references the store - which also happens to be the object of the preposition 'to' (à).; 2) them: Cars... I have some of them/those. 'Them/those' references the object of the preposition 'of' (de).; 3) those/that: I have none of this/that. 'This/that' references the object of the preposition 'of' (de).,pronouns
When do you use the pronom Y?,Rule of thumb: Y is a pronoun that replaces a place. It means 'there'. e.g. Je vais À Paris. becomes... J'Y vais. (I go there.).; The more correct rule: Y is an adverbial pronoun that replaces a noun that is the object of the preposition À. Y can replace any noun that is the object of preposition À EXCEPT an animate object (including people).; This means that you first need to understand whether a verb requires À (use Y) or DE (use EN).; NB: If the structure is À + NOUN and the noun is an animate object...then use a pronom tonique instead of Y.; Pronunciation: Pronom Y is pronounced 'ee'. So J'y is pronounced 'gee'.,pronouns
When do you use the pronom EN?,Rule of thumb: EN is a pronoun that replaces something that has a count/quantity to it (either clearly or vaguely). e.g. J'en voudrais. = I want one (of those).; The more correct rule: EN is an adverbial pronoun that replaces a quantity or a noun that is the object of the preposition DE.; This means that you first need to understand whether a verb requires À (use Y) or DE (use EN). e.g. Il cherche DEs idées. (He looks for ideas.) becomes... Il EN cherche. (He looks for some.); EN can replace any of the following: an entire phrase + a noun + un/une/des + du/de la/des,pronouns
When is it difficult to determine when to use Y vs EN?,For example when someone says: I'm thinking about X. And then the next sentence references X as a pronoun. Whether you use EN or Y to reference X depends on whether you say (in french) Je pense à X or Je pense de X. So you have to memorize whether to use verb + à X or verb + de X. Then this determines whether you use Y (replaces à X) or EN (replaces de X). And some verbs (like PENSER) can use both à and de ... it changes the meaning.,pronouns
Where do you place pronom Y or pronom EN in a phrase?,Pronom Y/EN are placed last after all over pronouns. This means that they are placed directly before the verb (before the auxiliary in passé composé).; NB: Only PAS (no pronouns) comes between the auxiliary and past participle in passé composé.,pronouns
I went to Beijing. + I went there.,Je suis allé(e) à Pékin. + J'y suis allé(e).; 'there' is an adverbial pronoun refering to 'Beijing'. In this case we use the pronom Y (instead of EN) because the verb (ALLER) is always followed by À (instead of DE).; Another way to remember this is that we generally use pronom Y when referring to a location.,pronouns
I come from Shanghai. + I come from there.,Je viens de Shanghai. + J'EN viens.; Use pronom EN to replace Shanghai (instead of Y) because VENIR triggers DE (not À).,pronouns
I think about my country. + I think about it.,Je pense À mon pays. + J'Y pense.; Use pronom Y (instead of pronom EN) because we use PENCER À to mean to think about something / to have it on the mind. (PENSER DE means to have an opinion about something.) So the object of the preposition à (my country) is replaced with Y.,pronouns
I will think about it.,J'y penserai.; PENSER in futur simple.; Use pronom Y (instead of pronom EN) because we use PENCER À to mean to think about something. (PENSER DE means to have an opinion about something.) So the object of the preposition à is replaced with Y when we need a pronoun.,pronouns
I think about Simone. + I think about her.,Je pense À Simone. + Je pense À ELLE.; PENSER À means to think about something / to have it on the mind. (PENSER DE means to have an opinion about something).; Use pronom tonique (elle instead of Y) because the object of the preposition (Simone) is a person.,pronouns
I talk about my friend. + I talk about them.,Je parle DE mon ami. + J'EN parle.; Use pronom EN (instead of pronom Y) because the verb PARLER uses DE to introduce the subject of conversation.,pronouns
You eat meat? + Yes I eat some from time to time.,Tu manges de la viande? + Oui j'EN mange de temps en temps.; Use pronom EN to refer to quantities of nouns with partitive articles (de / de la / des).,pronouns
You want a coffee? + Yes I'll have one. ,Tu veux un café? + Oui j'EN veux.; 'one' is an adverbial pronoun refering to 'coffee'. Use pronom EN to refer to quantities of nouns with indefinite articles (un/une/des).; VOULOIR DE qqch/qqn = to want something/someone,pronouns
They want telephones. + They want some.,Ils veulent des téléphones. + Ils EN veulent.; 'some' is an adverbial pronoun refering to 'telephones'. Use pronom EN to refer to quantities of nouns.,pronouns
We predict 80 billion connected objects in 2020. + We predict 80 billion of them in 2020.,On prévoit 80 milliards d'objects connectées en 2020. + On EN prévoit 80 milliards en 2020.; Use pronom EN to refer to quantities of nouns.,pronouns
I change the train. + I change it.,Je change DE train. + J'EN change.; Use pronom EN (instead of pronom Y) because the verb CHANGER uses DE (instead of à). Therefore the object of the preposition (the train) is replaced with EN.,pronouns
I need a television. + I need one.,J'ai besoin D'une télé(vision). + J'EN ai besoin.; 'one' is an adverbial pronoun refering to 'a television'. In this case we use the pronom EN (instead of Y) because the verb (AVOIR besoin) is always followed by DE (instead of À).; Another way to remember this is that we use pronom EN when referring to a quantity of something (one television).,pronouns
I have it. + I do not have it.,J'EN ai. ('zshoh-nay') + Je n'EN ai pas. ('zshuh-noh-nay-pah'); These are very common french expressions. This is typically how you express these phrases in french.; Use pronom EN to refer to the thing that you have or do not have because it clearly or vaguely has a count/quantity. AVOIR triggers use of pronom EN.; If you are really referring to a very specific thing that was explicitly discussed before this phrase then you can use a regular pronoun (e.g. le) instead of pronom EN to refer to 'it': I have it. = Je l'ai. (le + ai = l'ai),pronouns
I like to go to the Mediterranean Sea. + I like to go there. + I like the climate there.,J'aime aller à la mer Méditerranée. + J'aime Y aller. (Y is placed before the infinitive verb that it modifies.) + J'aime le climat là-bas.; In the last case it doesn't make sense to use Y to replace 'there'. The verb AIMER must be connected to the object (le climat). What we really mean is that we like the climate 'over there'.,pronouns
I am looking forward to the concert. + I am looking forward to being there.,J'ai hâte ('hat') DE le concert. + J'ai hâte d'Y être.; Use pronom Y to replace an event (the concert) even though the pronom DE is in play.; If the thing you are looking forward to is a verb then use DE + INFINITIVE.,pronouns
I am really looking forward to being on vacation.,J'ai vraiment hâte D'être en vacances.,vocabulary
I have not gone to the Netherlands.,Je ne suis pas allé(e) aux Pays-Bas.; Use ALLER instead of ÊTRE.; NE always comes directly after the subject (before any pronouns). PAS goes between the auxiliary and past participle in passé composé.,pronouns
I have not gone there.,Je n'Y suis pas allé(e).; Use pronom Y to replace À + location.; Use ALLER instead of ÊTRE.; NE always comes directly after the subject (before any pronouns). PAS goes between the auxiliary and past participle in passé composé.,pronouns
I have never been/gone there.,Je n'Y suis jamais allé(e).; Use pronom Y to replace À + location.; NE always comes directly after the subject (before any pronouns). JAMAIS replaces PAS (between the auxiliary and past participle in passé composé).,pronouns
I have never been/gone to Japan or Vietnam.,Je ne suis jamais allé(e) au Japon et au Vietnam.; You can use ET (and) or OU (or) here - they are both correct.; JAMAIS replaces PAS.,pronouns
I had never been to the Netherlands. (...before some other event),Je n'étais jamais allé(e) aux Pays-Bas.; JAMAIS replaces PAS.; Use plus que parfait tense (past perfect; 'had done something') because the action was completed before some other action. Plus que parfait: être/avoir conjugated in imparfait + past participle.,pronouns
I had never been there. (...before some other event),Je n'Y étais jamais allé(e).; Use pronom Y to reference À + location. NE always comes directly after the subject (before any pronouns). JAMAIS replaces PAS.; Use plus que parfait tense (past perfect; 'had done something'). Plus que parfait: être/avoir conjugated in imparfait + past participle.,pronouns
I really do not want to go there.,Je ne veux vraiment pas Y aller.; Pronom Y is placed closest to the verb to which it is most directly related.; When you negate VOULOIR it is unusual to use the conditionnel tense (even when you would use it in the un-negated form). Use: ne veux pas (instead of ne voudrais pas).,pronouns
It was good to be there at that time.,C'etait bien d'Y être à moment lá.,pronouns
I prefer to go there on foot.,Je préfère Y aller à pieds.; The pronom Y is placed in between the verbs because it is more closely related to ALLER than to PRÉFÉRER.,pronouns
I would install it. + I would like to install it.,J'Y installerais. + J'aimerais Y installer.; INSTALLER uses À so 'it' is replaced by pronom Y.; Both sentences use the conditionnel présent.; The second phrase is a slight exception because pronom Y comes after one of the verbs (instead of before the verb which is generally the rule).,pronouns
How do you know which preposition to use in front of an infinitive verb?,1) Always use 'pour' if you could replace the phrase with 'in order to do x'. You are providing a reason/explanation for doing something.; 2) In the remainder of cases use with À or DE and the rules are not fixed or straightforward.,verbs
How do you know whether to use À vs DE in front of an infinitive verb?,1) In many cases the preceding word (verb or adjective) determines whether to use À or DE. (e.g. Tu es prêt(e) À danser. + Tu es content(e) DE danser.); 2) AVOIR + NOUN + DE: This pattern always requires DE. (e.g. J'ai besoin DE qqch. J'ai envie DE qqch.); 3) In some cases the preceding verb can use both À or DE and it will change the meaning. (e.g. Je décide qqun À faire qqch. = I persuade someone to do something. OR Je décide DE faire qqch. = I decide to do something.); 4) In some cases use À if the infinitive verb is not followed by an object: Cette leçon est facile À comprendre. 5) In some cases use DE if the infinitive verb is followed by an object: C'est facile DE comprendre cette leçon.,verbs
What are expressions impersonnelles and which prepositions do they trigger?,Impersonal expressions have the formula: generic subject + conjugated être + adjective + preposition + verb. (e.g. It's possible to do. It's easy to do. It's absurd to do.) In English these expressions always use the preposition TO + INFINITIVE. But in French sometimes À + INFINITIVE is correct and sometimes DE + INFINITIVE is correct. Whether you use À or DE depends on whether the generic subject refers to something real (use À) or whether it is truly a dummy subject (use DE).,verbs
What is the difference between these two expressions impersonnelles: C'est/Il est difficile de parler. C'est/Il est bon à savoir.,C'est difficile de parler. = It's difficult to speak. This means 'speaking is difficult'. The subject (C'est/Il) in this case is a 'dummy' - it doesn't really exist. So we must use DE before the infinitive.; C'est bon à savoir. = It's good to know. The subject (C'est/Il) in this case refers to something real - a piece of information that was likely mentioned previously. So we must use À before the infinitive.,verbs
It's impossible to find. + It's important to study.,C'est/Ils est impossible À trouver. (Use À + INFINITIVE because the generic subject refers to something real that was likely mentioned previously. You wouldn't rephrase as: Finding is impossible.) + C'est/Il est important D'étudier. (Use DE + INFINITIVE because the generic subject is truly a dummy. We could rephrase as: Studying is important.),verbs
It's easy/difficult to cook.,Il/C'est facile/difficile DE cuisiner.; It's easy/difficult to do something is almost always a completely generic impersonal expression. The subject 'it' is just a dummy subject so we use DE (instead of À) before the infinitive.; If you can rephrase it like: Cooking is easy/difficult. ...then you know that the subject is a dummy and you can use DE (instead of À).,verbs
It's difficult to eat the entire meal.,Il/C'est difficile DE manger tout le repas.; It's easy/difficult to do something is almost always a completely generic impersonal expression. The subject 'it' is a dummy subject - it doesn't really exist. So use DE (instead of À) before the infinitive. It could be rephrased: Eating an entire meal is difficult.,verbs
It's difficult to anticipate.,Il/C'est difficile À anticiper.; In this case the thing being anticipated is a real subject. We are just using the pronoun (it) because the subject was mentioned previously. So use À (instead of DE) before the infinitive.; This cannot be rephrased as: Anticipating is difficult.,verbs
It's easy for us to leave earlier.,Il/C'est facile pour nous DE partir plus tôt.; In this case the subject 'it' is a dummy subject - it doesn't really exist. So use DE (instead of À) before the infinitive.,verbs
Learning is difficult. + Literature is difficult to learn.,Il/C'est difficile D'apprendre. + La littérature est difficile À apprendre.; The first phrase is impersonal. We could rephrase: It is difficult to learn. ...The subject is a dummy - it does not really exist. So we use DE (instead of À) before the infinitive.; In the second phrase the subject (literature) is a real thing - whether we use a pronoun or not. So use À (instead of DE) before the infinitive.,verbs
It is difficult to explain.,Il/C'est difficile À expliquer.; Generally when we express that something is easy/hard to do (e.g. It's easy to swim.)... the subject is a dummy - it doesn't really exist. But in this case the subject (it) is something real. We are only using a pronoun to represent it because the subject was mentioned previously. So use preposition À (instead of DE) before the infinitive.; We could not rephrase this as: Explaining is difficult.,verbs
It's difficult to swim. + It's difficult to do.,Il/C'est difficile DE nager. + Il/C'est difficile À faire.; The first phrase is impersonal where the subject is a dummy. It could be rephrased: Swimming is difficult. So use DE (instead of À) before the infinitive.; The second phrase is not impersonal. It cannot be rephrased: Doing is difficult. The subject (it) is a real pronoun that represents a real thing. So use À (instead of DE) before the infintive.,verbs
It's important to sleep.,C'est important DE dormir.; Use DE (instead of À) before the infinitive because the generic subject is truly a dummy - it doesn't really exist. We could rephrase as: Sleeping is important.,verbs
It's absurd to find. + It's absurd to find a route.,Il/C'est absurde À trouver. + Il/C'est absurde DE trouver une route.; In the first phrase the subject is real (the subject pronoun represents a real thing). So use À (instead of DE) in front of the infinitive.; In the second phrase the subject is a dummy - it doesn't really exist. The thing that is absurd is located in the second part of the sentence. So use DE (instead of À) before the infinitive.,verbs
the song to sing,la chanson À chanter; In this case À is the correct preposition before the infinitive.,verbs
What is a demonstrative article/adjective?,this/that e.g. this cat + that whale; Demonstrative articles precede a noun. They act like an adjective modifying the noun to show (in real life) exactly which one you are talking about.; Demonstrative articles do not stand on their own. If you need a word to mean 'that one' (where the noun is absent) then you are using a demonstrative pronoun (now a demonstrative article/adjective).,vocabulary
What are the demonstrative articles/adjectives (e.g. this X + that X) in french? How are they pronounced?,There are three: Ce 'suh' (masculine singular) + Cette 'set' (feminine singular) + Ces 'sayz' (plural regardless of gender),vocabulary
this bra,ce soutein-gorge (masculine),vocabulary
this baseball hat,cette casquette (feminine),vocabulary
these gloves,ces gants (plural),vocabulary
these pajamas,ce pyjama (masculine); pyjama is singular in french but plural in english,vocabulary
this article (article is spelled the same in french but is masculine),cet article ('suh-tar-teecl') is masculine singular; Normally we use CE for masculine singular but here the noun starts with a vowel so we change CE to CET.; cette and cet are pronounced exactly the same because the T sound is required in cet to manage the following noun that starts with a vowel.,vocabulary
this apartment,cet appartement (pronounce as a single word); appartement is masculine so normally we would use CE (instead of CETTE). But the noun starts with a vowel. So CE transforms to CET.,vocabulary
this summer,cet été ('set-a-tay'); Êté (summer) is masculine so we would normally choose CE. But the noun starts with a vowel so we change CE to CET.; cette and cet are pronounced the same. The T sound is required in cet (even though an E does not follow the final T) in order to manage the following noun that starts with a vowel.,vocabulary
this island,cette île ('se-teel'); Île (island) is feminine. Use CETTE regardless of whether or not the noun starts with a vowel.,vocabulary
What is a demostrative pronoun?,A demonstrative pronoun stands alone in place of a noun. It shows which one you are talking about without mentioning the noun at all. e.g. THIS (one) bit me. THE ONE who bit me.; Pronouns in English that can be used as demonstrative pronouns are: this + that + these + those.; NB: In English we sometimes say 'this/that one' or 'these/those ones' instead of simply this/that/these/those. But French is more deterministic in terms of word choice.,pronouns
What are the demonstrative pronouns (this/these) in French?,Regular demonstrative pronouns must agree in gender and number with the noun that they represent: celui (masc sing) + celle (fem sing) + ceux (masc pl) + celles (fem pl). Additionally there are indefinite/neuter demonstrative pronouns that do not agree in gender/number: ça + ce + ceci + cela.; e.g. NB: In French demonstrative pronouns CANNOT be used to represent people - only things.; NB: CE can be either a demonstrative article/adjective or an indefinite/neuter demonstrative pronoun.,pronouns
After talking about hats... How do you say?: the one that is on the chair,celui qui est sur la chaise; CELUI is the masculine singular demonstrative pronoun (= this/that/the one).,pronouns
After talking about dresses... How do you say?: the one that is on the bed,celle qui est sur le lit; CELLE is the feminine singular demonstrative pronoun (= this/that/the one).,pronouns
After talking about hats... How do you say?: the ones that on the couch,ceux qui sont sur le canapé; CEUX is the masculine plural demonstrative pronoun (= these/those/the ones).,pronouns
After talking about dresses... How do you say?: the ones that are on the table,celles qui sont sur la table; CELLES is the feminine plural demonstrative pronoun (= these/those/the ones).,pronouns
After talking about a person... How do you say?: the one over there,cette personne là; We cannot use demonstrative pronouns (celui/celle/ceux/celles) to reference people - only things. So here we switched to a demonstrative article (cette) which - along with a noun - can be used for people.,pronouns
For she who likes spending time with friends...,Pour celle (feminine singular) qui aime passer du bon temps entre amis...,pronouns
For he who eats and drinks all day...,Pour celui (masculine singular) qui mange et boire toute la journée...,pronouns
For those who go on adventure...,Pour ceux (plural with unknown gender) qui partent à l'adventure...,pronouns
I am one who danses all night.,Je suis ceux/celle (depending on whether the speaker is feminine or masculine) danse toute la soirée.; Alternative for 'all night': toutes les nuits jusqu'au matin,pronouns
more than that one,plus que celui-là; The gender of what we are referencing is unknown so use the generic masculine demonstrative pronoun: celui.,pronouns
When you are physically pointing out something... This one (here). (m/f),The thing is singular: celui-ci (m) / celle-ci (f); We are just adding 'here' (ici) to the singular demonstrative pronouns (celui and celle) that mean this/that/the one.,pronouns
When you are physically pointing out something... These ones (here). (m/f),The things are plural: ceux-ci (m) / celles-ci (f); We are just adding 'here' (ici) to the plural demonstrative pronouns (ceux and celles) that mean these/those/the ones.,pronouns
When you are physically pointing out something... That one (there). (m/f),The thing is singular: celui-là (m) / celle-là (f); We are just adding 'there' (là) to the singular demonstrative pronouns (celui and celle) that mean this/that/the one.,pronouns
When you are physically pointing out something... Those ones (there). (m/f),The things are plural: ceux-là (m) / celles-là (f); We are just adding 'there' (là) to the plural demonstrative pronouns (ceux and celles) that mean these/those/the ones.,pronouns
When do you use voilà vs voici?,The suffixes change the meaning. -là (there) vs -ici (here). Voilà is more general like a conclusion e.g. There it is. There you have it.; Voici is tangible like something you have in your hand that you are showing or giving e.g. Here he/she/it is. Here they are. Here you go.,pronouns
What do you say when you come to a conclusion. e.g. There you have it.,voilà; If you are instead displaying or giving over something tangible like change or a document then use voici instead of voilà.,pronouns
What do you say when you hand over a document (le document)?,LE voici or voici; Literally: Here he is.; Use voici (instead of voilà) because you are showing or handing over something tangible that is right there.,pronouns
What do you say when you hand over a carte vitale (la carte vitale)?,LA voici or voici; Literally: Here she is.; Use voici (instead of voilà) because you are showing or handing over something tangible that is right there.,pronouns
What do you say when you hand over some objects (des objets)?,LES voici or voici; Literally: Here they are.; Use voici (instead of voilà) because you are showing or handing over something tangible that is right there.,pronouns
What is ça?,Ça ('sah') is an indefinite/neuter demonstrative pronoun. It means 'this/that (one)'. It is a more familiar alternative to the other indefinite demonstrative pronouns: ce + ceci + cela.; It is also an alternative to demonstrative pronouns that must agree in gender/number with the noun they represent: celui + celle + ceux + celles.,pronouns
What is ce?,Ce is an indefinite/neuter demonstrative pronoun. It means 'this/that (one)'. CE can only be followed by a small selection of verbs: être + pouvoir + devoir. Furthermore if there is a double verb then the second verb must also be one of those three. For example you cannot say: Ce doit commencer. But you could say: Ce doit être.,pronouns
This/That is... +  These/Those are...,C'est ('say')...  + Ce sont ('suh-son')... ; NB: Avoid 'Ce sont'. Treat CE as a singular subject or use an alternative (e.g. Ils/Elles sont... + Il y a...); CE is a generic indefinite/neuter demonstrative pronoun. CE is special because it is only used with the verbs être + pouvoir + devoir. If you use a different verb then you must use ÇA instead of CE.; NB: CE always contracts when followed by a word that starts with a vowel. ÇA contracts some of the time but not always.,pronouns
This/That is not... + These/Those are not...,Ce n'est pas... + Ce ne sont pas...; CE is a generic indefinite/neuter demonstrative pronoun. CE is special because it is only used with the verbs être + pouvoir + devoir. If you use a different verb then you must use ÇA instead of CE.; NB: CE always contracts when followed by a word that starts with a vowel. ÇA contracts some of the time but not always.,pronouns
It's not complicated.,If you choose an indefinite/neuter demonstrative pronoun (to represent it) then there are two options: 1) Ça n'est pas compliqué. 2) Ce n'est pas compliqué.; The meanings are the same.,pronouns
It begins.,Ça commence.; You cannot say: Ce commence. because CE can only be used with the verbs être + pouvoir + devoir.,pronouns
What do ceci and cela mean?,Both are indefinite/neuter demonstrative pronouns (like ça and ce).; CECI = this here. It is a contraction of CE (indefinite/neuter demonstrative pronoun meaning this/that one) and ICI (here).; CELA = that there. It is a contraction of CE and LÀ (there).; ÇA can be used as an alternative to all of these and it is the best choice for most scenarios. Use ceci and cela in very formal communication.; C'est is a contraction of all of these. It can stand for cela + est OR ceci + est OR ça + est. All are singular and they always contract with être (est).,pronouns
What is an independant clause vs a subordinate clause?,An independent clause stands on its own as a complete sentence. A subordinate clause supports an independent clause. It must be joined with an independent clause to form a complete sentence. e.g. I have a hat (independent) that is green (subordinate). I wake up early (independent) because I must go to school (subordinate).; Subordinate clauses are categorized by how they are linked to the independent clause. If the subordinate clause uses a relative pronoun to give more information about a noun then it is relative clause. If the subordinate clause uses a conjonctive / conjonctive phrase to explain why or how something occurs then it is a conjonctive clause.,pronouns
What are relative clauses and conjonctive clauses?,Both are a type of subordinate clause (that cannot form a complete sentence on its own). 1) Relative clauses provide additional information often about a noun. e.g. He is the person (independent clause) of whom you spoke (relative clause). 2) Conjonctive clauses (aka conjonctions de subordination) provide logic - a reason for why or how something occurs. e.g. I can go with you (independent clause) if you like (conjonctive clause).; Relative clauses often use que + qui + quoi + dont + où. Conjonctive clauses often use que + parce que + si +quand.,pronouns
What is the difference between a restrictive and a descriptive clause?,Both are types of relative clauses (subordinate clauses that provide additional information often about a noun).; Restrictive Clause: Hones in on a subgroup or a single item that you are talking about. It is necessary to the meaning of the sentence (therefore not separated from the sentence by pair of commas). It should use 'that' (instead of 'which'). e.g. I like roller coasters THAT have lots of loops.; Descriptive Clause: Adds contextual information about the noun. It is not necessary to the meaning of the sentence (therefore it is separated from the sentence by pair of commas). It should use 'which' (instead of 'that'). e.g. The students complained about the book` WHICH was hard to follow.; In English we need to know the difference between a restrictive clause and a descriptive clause in order to choose the correct relative pronoun: 'that' (restrictive clauses) or 'which' (descriptive clauses).,pronouns
What are les relatifs (relative pronouns)?,A pronoun that shows a relationship between a noun and a clause. Relative pronouns introduce a relative clause (a phrase that gives more information about the subject). Relative pronouns can be used to connect phrases that have the same subject to avoid repitition.; Example: A hat is on the table. This hat is blue. ...becomes... The hat THAT is on the table is blue. THAT is the relative pronoun. 'that is on the table' is the relative clause.,pronouns
What are the les relatifs (list the actual pronouns) in English and French?, Examples of relative pronouns in English: that + which + who + whom + whose + where + when. Examples of relative pronouns in French: qui + que + lequel + auquel + duquel + dont + où.; The choice of word is more flexible in English than it is in French. In French the preposition in play often dictates which relative pronoun to use.; NB: Many relative pronoun words are the same as demonstrative pronouns/articles (used to show exactly which one) and as interrogative pronouns (used to ask a question). But in the cases of demonstrative articles/pronouns and interrogative pronouns... the words are serving a different purpose than when they are being used as relative pronouns.,pronouns
the woman who is walking by,La femme QUI passe.; Use relative pronoun QUI because 'who' in this case represents the subject (the person/thing doing the action). Hint: Use QUI when the relative pronoun is followed directly by a verb (or COI/COD pronouns + verb),pronouns
the hat that I am wearing,Le chapeau QUE je porte.; Use relative pronoun QUE because 'that' in this case represents a direct object (the person/thing receiving the action). Hint: Use QUE when the relative pronoun is followed directly by the subject (not a verb).,pronouns
the woman who arrives,La femme QUI arrive.; QUI does not contract when followed by a vowel (unlike que)!; Use relative pronoun QUI because 'who' in this case represents the subject doing the action. Hint: Use QUI when the relative pronoun is followed directly by a verb (or COI/COD pronouns + verb).,pronouns
the man that she likes,Le homme QU'ELLE aime.; QUE contracts when followed by a vowel (unlike qui)!; Use relative pronoun QUE because 'that' in this case represents the object receiving the action.

you (formal) who look at yourself in the mirror,Vous QUI vous regardez dans le miroir.; Use QUI (instead of QUE) because it represents the subject and is followed by the verb.; This is a case where a conjugated verb does not follow QUI directly.

the person who you (formal) are watching,La personne QUE vous regardez.; The relative pronoun 'who' represents the object of the verb so use QUE instead of QUI.; In this case the verb (REGARDER) is not reflexive because one thing is watching another thing.

Generally if you are trying to avoid ending a sentence with the preposition DE... then DONT is the solution.; DONT can mean the following in English (though the translation is not direct): from which/whom + of which/whom + including + which + who + that,pronouns

When do you use Qu'est-ce que...? vs Qu'est-ce qui...?,The relative pronouns QUE and QUI work the same in questions as they do in statements. So Qu'est-ce QUE... is followed by a subject + verb. Qu'est ce QUI is followed by a verb (or COI/COD pronouns + verb). Generally you use the latter (QUI) when the subject has been dropped from the question (either out of necessity for meaning or in casual conversation). When the subject is dropped from a question... one must use Qu'est-ce qui...? (instead of Qu'est-ce que...?),questions
What is harder?,Qu'est-ce QUI plus dur?; We must follow Qu'est-ce with QUI (instead of que) because there is no explicit subject in this question. Use QUI when what follows is a verb.; NB: ce qui is pronounced 'ski' in conversation.,questions
How do you ask 'What happened?' in two ways? 1) using Qu'est-ce que...? 2) using Qu'est-ce qui...?,1) Less familiar (no dropped subject): Qu'est-ce qu'il (QUE + il) s'est passé? 2) More familiar (dropped subject): Qu'est-ce QUI s'est passé?; In the latter example we must use QUI (instead of QUE) because we follow with a verb (the subject is omitted). This is a requirement even though the subject is dropped as an informality.,questions

When does one use lequel/laquelle/lesquels/lesquelles?,These are the french relative pronouns that mean 'the one which'. They reference indirect objects (as opposed to QUE which references direct objects). They follow the prepositions pour + avec. If they follow à or de then the pronoun mutates slightly.; Rule of thumb: If in English you are tempted to end a sentence with a preposition (which you should not) then this is generally the time when lequel/... is used. Example: the pen that I write with (should be 'the pen with which I write') = le stylo avec LEQUEL j'écris.,pronouns
When do you use quel vs lequel?,Quel/quelle/quels/quelles is an adjective. e.g. Quel chapeau... ? = Which hat...?; Lequel/laquelle/lesquels/lesquelles is a pronoun so it can stand on it's own. e.g. Lequel...? = Which one...?,pronouns
When do you use qui vs lequel?,Generally the relative pronouns lequel/... are only used in writing. It is a formal type of expression. So if you are speaking and need to reference an indirect object then it is more common to use QUI (instead of lequel/...). e.g. Je voudrais le chapeau qui est rouge. = I want the hat which is red.; There is an exception. When asking a question in speech it is more common to use LEQUEL/... e.g. Lequel voudrais-tu? = Which one do you want?,pronouns
the book for which she is famous.,le livre pour lequel elle est connu(e); lequel because livre is masculine singular; When you use a relative pronoun (which) with an indirect object (the book) - often with a preposition à or de or pour - then you must use the indirect pronoun that agrees with the noun: lequel (masc sing) + laquelle (fem sing) + lesquels (masc pl) + lesquelles (fem pl),pronouns

Technically you can use both lequel and qui to represent a person.,pronouns
Which one is the least expensive?,Lequel est le moins cher?; lequel = the one which. It stands on it's own as a pronoun.; In this case we use lequel (instead of laquelle/lesquels/lesquelles) because we do not know the antecedent so we default to singular masculine form.,pronouns
